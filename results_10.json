        "Ralph Lopes\n\nSir Ralph Lopes, 2nd Baronet( 10 September 1788 ÔÇô 23 January 1854), of Maristow in the parish of Tamerton Foliot, Devon, was a British Member of Parliament( MP). Lopes was born as Ralph Franco. His uncle, Manasseh Masseh Lopes, an MP and borough owner, was created a baronet in 1805, with a special remainder to his nephew. Ralph entered Parliament in 1814 as member for Westbury, a pocket borough controlled by his uncle, for which he initially sat until 1819. On his uncle's death in 1831 he inherited both the baronetcy and his estate, a condition of which was that he change his surname to Lopes. Included in the estate was the right to nominate the MPs at Westbury( though this did not survive the Great Reform Act of the following year), and he resumed his seat for the borough. Although he had originally sat as a Tory like his uncle, he now expressed his support for the Reform Bill and sat with the Whigs. Having been three times elected unopposed, Ralph switched his loyalties during the 1835 Parliament from the Whigs back to the Conservatives, and at the 1837 election a Whig candidate stood against him and defeated him, by the narrow margin of 98 votes to 96. However, at the next election, in 1841, Lopes was once again elected unopposed, this time as a Conservative. In 1847 he stood down in Westbury, not contesting the election, but two years later he returned to the Commons at a by-election for the Southern Devon county division. He held this seat until his death in 1854. His older son, Sir Massey Lopes, succeeded him as baronet; a younger son, Henry Lopes, 1st Baron Ludlow, served in Parliament and later as a Lord Justice of Appeal before being granted a peerage in 1897.",
        "Servant (band)\n\nServant was a Christian rock group that grew out of the counter- culture Jesus Movement of the sixties and seventies. The band was founded in Victoria, British Columbia in 1976 by Jim Palosaari and performed to audiences throughout North America, Europe and Australia for over 12 years. Originally named\" Higher Ground\", the group later changed their name to Servant. The lyrics of their songs were known for challenging the Christian Church to turn back to social justice and caring for the poor. A Servant rock concert was like a festival event. The band was known to incorporate comedy and short skits in their sets on stage. Servant was also the first Christian rock group to use laser lights, flame tubes, fireworks, fog machines, in addition to an extensive light show and quadraphonic sound( a precursor to surround- sound). In the early 1980s some critics considered Servant's theatrics, light shows, smoke- bombs and flash- pot stage performances too raucous to be authentically Christian. However, the band's mission was to reach the ears and hearts of those who might not feel so comfortable in church buildings. Shying away from the praise lyrics and easy- listening rock styles that typified most contemporary Christian music at the time, Servant instead attempted to offer edgy, rhythmic, passionate rock and an aggressive stage performance filled with an evangelistic Christian message, and spiced with strong social commentaries. A\" CCM Magazine\" review of their 1981 release,\" Rockin' Revival\", stated that the band's lyrics reflected Christian communal subculture, and contained elements of social protest and criticism. Servant toured extensively throughout America, Europe and Australia in concert halls and at music festivals like\" Creation\" and\" Greenbelt\". They recorded 6 studio albums with songs that ranked in the Top 40 Contemporary Christian Music Charts including\" Come Jesus ComeHolding on to YouThank GodWe are the LightSurrender Harder to Finish\", and\" I Will\". From 1981 to 1985, opening acts for Servant included Grammy Award- winning Petra, DeGarmo& Key, Joe English( of Paul McCartney& Wings fame), Will McFarlane( recorded with Jackson Browne), Randy Matthews, Jerusalem, and Steve Camp. Petra opened for Servant on tour in late 1981 and early 1982 just as Petra's breakthrough album, Never Say Die was being released. The band reunited to perform a one- off concert at Cornerstone Festival in July 2011. In November 2013, Servant was awarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award from GMA Canada during ceremonies held during the 35th Annual Covenant Awards. On hand to receive the award were band members: Sandie Brock, Owen Brock, Bob Hardy, Rob Martens, Matt Spransy and Eric Odell."

        "Idealism\n\nBradley was the apparent target of G. E. Moore's radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article The Refutation of Idealism is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism esse est percipi, \"to be is to be perceived\", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are necessarily connected so that \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" are identical - \"to be yellow\" is \"to be experienced as yellow\". But it also seems there is a difference between \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" and \"that esse is held to be percipi, solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it\". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley. This argument did not show that the GEM (in postÔÇôStove vernacular, see below) is logically invalid.",

        "The Italian Job\n\nThe Italian Job is a 1969 British comedy caper film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin, produced by Michael Deeley and directed by Peter Collinson. It tells the story of Charlie Croker (Michael Caine), the leader of a cockney criminal gang released from prison with the intention of doing a \"big job\" in Italy to steal gold bullion from an armoured security truck. Its soundtrack was composed by Quincy Jones, and includes \"On Days Like These\" sung by Matt Monro over the opening credits, and \"Getta Bloomin' Move On\" (usually referred to as \"The Self-Preservation Society\", after its chorus) during the climactic car chase. Lead actor Michael Caine is among its singers. The popularity of the film has led to parodies and allusions in other films and productions, including a 2003 remake, a reference in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"The Italian Bob\", and a re-enactment of the Mini Cooper car-chase in the \"MacGyver\" episode ÔÇ£Thief of BudapestÔÇØ. The film has inspired The Italian Job charity event that has taken place annually since 1990 and involves Minis and other vehicles featured in the original film, driving from the UK to northern Italy and back, visiting Grand Prix circuits, historic Italian cities and the locations in Turin featured in the film, while fundraising for children's charities. The event has raised nearly ┬ú2,600,000 so far.

Mahurin's work as a photo essayist has dealt with subjects such as homelessness, people with AIDS, the Texas prison system, abortion clinics, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Belfast. His extensive work directing music videos since 1986 have resulted in working with U2, Queensr├┐che, Metallica, Dreams So Real, Jaye Muller (J.), Tracy Chapman, Tom Waits, R.E.M., Alice In Chains and many other popular music performers.

Mahurin has a reputation for photographing himself and manipulating his own likeness in his commercial photo-illustration work. Examples of his own image appearing on magazine covers are the November 29, 1993 cover of \"Time\", with Mahurin as Sigmund Freud, the March 14, 1994 cover of \"Time\", with himself as a caveman and the May 17, 2004 \"Time\" cover where Mahurin posed and photographed himself as an Abu Ghraib prisoner. Mahurin is also credited with a notorious \"Time\" cover of O.J. Simpson, featuring an altered mugshot which removed the photograph's color saturation (inadvertently making Simpson's skin darker), burned the corners, and reduced the size of the prisoner ID number. This appeared on newsstands next to an unaltered copy on the cover of Newsweek, which occasioned some controversy over photo manipulation."

        "So geht das jede Nacht\n\n\"So geht das jede Nacht\" (English translation: \"That's How It Is Every Night\") was the second German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 (the rules of that Contest allowed two entries per country, the only time that this was the case), performed in German by Freddy Quinn. The song was performed eleventh on the night (following Belgium's Mony Marc with \"Le plus beau jour de ma vie\" and preceding France's Dany Dauberson with \"Il est l├á\"). As the scoreboard for this Contest has never been made public, it is impossible to make any definite statements about the song's final place or score - other than the fact that it did not win. With music by Lotar Olias and lyrics by Peter M├Âsser, the song is an up-tempo number in the style of early rock and roll hits like \"Rock Around The Clock\" by Bill Haley & His Comets. In the song, Quinn explains to the object of his affections that he is not happy with the number of other men she goes out with over the course of the week. She sees Jimmy on Sunday, Jack on Monday, Johnny on Tuesday, Billy on Wednesday, Tommy on Thursday, Ben on Friday and \"someone I don't even know\" on Saturday. Quinn declares that \"I've loved you since you were a baby\" and explains that he drives her to the office, sends her flowers and \"takes you mother...to the zoo\" and thus feels that he deserves better treatment than this, but despite his abilities at dancing the boogie and cha-cha-cha, she ignores his entreaties.<br > The song ends with Quinn's own confession that \"But if you were thinking I've been sitting at home/ I've been going out with someone else every day\". Honours are thus even. The song achieved moderate fame in Japan, where it was rerecorded in Japanese as \"Kimi Wa Maiban No\". The song was accompanied at the 1956 contest by Walter Andreas Schwarz with \"Im Wartesaal zum gro├ƒen Gl├╝ck\" and was succeeded as German representative at the 1957 Contest by Margot Hielscher with \"Telefon, Telefon\".",

The ensemble was known for performing well- known masterworks and new music, and reviving lesser- known and forgotten masterworks rediscovered by Michell in libraries, shops, and private collections in Europe and America. These rediscovered works included piano quartets by Sergei Taneyev, Gustav Mahler, Alfred Schnittke, Camille Saint- Sa├½ns, and Vincent dÔÇÖ Indy, among others.

Koppel, Robert Starer, Tzvi Avni, Ben- Zion Orgad and ├ûd├Ân P├írtos. Partos ÔÇÖ was inspired after he and Michell were sitting on a balcony overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem when both were struck by the six oÔÇÖclock toll of the Christian Church bells and the call of the muezzin. Partos asked Michell what the notes were, and Michell identified them and suggested that Partos begin his new piece with the very same notes. A few months later, Michell received the ÔÇ£ Balada for Piano Quartet, ÔÇØ which begins and ends with the notes of the bells. She called Partos to thank him only to learn that he had died three days earlier, just after completing the composition.

Typically of the band, the lyrics are full of unusual imagery. The song deals, at least in part, with the power of love, as in lines such as\" If she refused ÔÇô there's no hope\". However, it has been suggested, and since confirmed by band member Danny Sanderson, that the song also contained a veiled political protest against the reign of then- prime minister, Golda Meir, and in favour of the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The song was performed sixth on the night( following Greece's Marinella with\" Krasi, Thalasa Ke T' Agori Mu\" and preceding Yugoslavia's Korni with\" Moja generacija\"). At the close of voting, it had received 11 points, placing 7th in a field of 17. It was succeeded as Israeli representative at the 1975 Contest by Shlomo Artzi with\" At Va' Ani\"."
