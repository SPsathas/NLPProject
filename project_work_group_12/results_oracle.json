David Lynch:
David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, actor, and photographer.
He is best known for films such as "Eraserhead" (1977), "Blue Velvet" (1986) and "Mulholland Drive" (2001), often regarded by critics as among the best films of their respective decades, and for his successful 1990–91 television series "Twin Peaks", which led to him being labeled "the first popular Surrealist" by noted film critic Pauline Kael.
A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, he has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and has won France's César Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival.
He has been described by "The Guardian" as "the most important director of this era", while AllMovie called him "the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking".
Born to a middle-class family in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States before he studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films.
He moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film "Eraserhead" (1977).
After "Eraserhead" became a success on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct the biographical film "The Elephant Man" (1980), from which he gained mainstream success.
He was then employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic "Dune" (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir mystery film "Blue Velvet" (1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation.
Next, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery entitled "Twin Peaks" (1990–1991).
He also created a cinematic prequel,  (1992), a road film "Wild at Heart" (1990) and a family film "The Straight Story" (1999) in the same period.
Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: "Lost Highway" (1997), "Mulholland Drive" (2001), and "Inland Empire" (2006).
Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the Internet as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated "DumbLand" (2002) and the surreal sitcom "Rabbits" (2002).
Lynch and Frost reunited for a third season of "Twin Peaks", airing in on Showtime in 2017.
Lynch co-wrote and directed every episode, as well as reprising his role as Gordon Cole.
Lynch's other artistic endeavours include: his work as a musician, encompassing three studio albums—"BlueBOB" (2001), "Crazy Clown Time" (2011) and "The Big Dream" (
2013)—as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing three books—"Images" (1994), "Catching the Big Fish" (2006), and "Room to Dream" (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the Dior promotional film "Lady Blue Shanghai" (2006).
An avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM), Lynch founded the David Lynch Foundation in 2005, which sought to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees.
In 2019, he received an Academy Honorary Award; his first Oscar win.

Ronnie Rocket:
Ronnie Rocket is an unfinished film project written by David Lynch, who also intended to direct it.
Begun after the success of Lynch's 1977 film "EraserheadRonnie Rocket" was shelved after Lynch felt he would be unable to find financial backing for the project.
He instead sought out an existing script on which to base his next film, settling on what would become 1980's "The Elephant Man".
"Ronnie Rocket" was to feature many of the elements which have since come to be seen as Lynch's hallmarks; including industrial art direction, 1950s popular culture and physical deformity.
The script featured a three-foot tall man with control over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J. Anderson when tentatively casting for this role, and later cast him in "Twin Peaks" and "Mulholland Drive" as a result.

Antiochus X Eusebes:
Antiochus X Eusebes Philopator (–92 or 88 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as the King of Syria between 95 BC and 92 BC or 89/88 BC (224 SE (Seleucid year)).
He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV.
He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians.
Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII.
Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king.
He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed.
Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers,
Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III.
Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC.
A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI.
This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved.
The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts.
AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII.
The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery.
The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC).
The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated.
Other accounts exist:
the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne.
Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians.
Numismatic evidence shows that AntiochusX was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital in SE (88/87 BC).

Cleopatra IV of Egypt:
Cleopatra IV  was Queen of Egypt briefly from 116 to 115 BC, jointly with her husband Ptolemy IX Lathyros.
She later became queen consort of Syria as the wife of Antiochus IX Cyzicenus.

Who is the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes?

Ptolemy IX Lathyros.
