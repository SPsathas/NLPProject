Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was ``not a cartoon character '', saying,`` It's not Bugs Bunny in the middle of the Avengers, it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean - ass fighting machine.'' Gunn also based the character on himself. Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, ``I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas guy. ''Cooper voiced Rocket, while Sean Gunn (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming. James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators, though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film. Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance`` the fast - talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket.''\n\nHeather Parry\nHeather Parry( born 1971) is a television and film producer.

She lived at the time of the Seleucid king of Syria Antiochus X Eusebes who reigned 95 BC- 92 or 88 BC.\n\nLaodice (wife of Mithridates III of Pontus)\nLaodice (fl. late 3rd \u2013 early 2nd centuries BCE) was a Greek Princess from the Seleucid Empire and the wife of King Mithridates III of Pontus. Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice and Laodice VI. Laodice bore Mithridates III three children: Mithridates IV of Pontus, Pharnaces I of Pontus and Laodice.\n\nAntiochus IX Cyzicenus\nAntiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus (\"Antiochus the Pious, the Cyzicene\") was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom.

In 112 BC, Antiochus IX's wife, Cleopatra IV, was killed by her sister Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus VIII. Tryphaena herself died shortly afterwards. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; he was succeeded by his sons Seleucus VI and Demetrius III. Antiochus IX then took the capital Antioch and married his deceased wife's sister Cleopatra Selene, who was herself the widow of Antiochus VIII. Seleucus VI continued the war against his uncle. Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus was killed in battle in 96 BC.\n\nAntiochus VII Sidetes\nAntiochus VII Euergetes (c.164/160 BC - 129 BC) , nicknamed Sidetes  (from Side, a city in Asia Minor), also known as Antiochus the Pious, was ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from July/August 138 to 129 BC.

The story begins with the death of a model worker, who is buried with his labor card as a badge of honor. However, his widow is told she needs that card to claim the benefits she is entitled to. The story then takes several surreal turns, as the family of the dead man tries to recover the precious card from the grave.
