The Bible records only that Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron and a cousin (or relative) of Mary. The name of Sobe first appears in writings of about the 8th century by Hippolytus of Thebes, Andrew of Crete, and Epiphanius Monachus, and later in Nicephorus Callistus and Andronicus. All recount essentially the same passage, given by the last two as follows: There were three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest, and Mary his wife, under the reign of Cleopatra and Sosipatrus, before the reign of Herod, the son of Antipater: the eldest was Mary, the second was Sobe, the youngest's name was Anne. The eldest being married in Bethlehem, had for daughter Salome the midwife; Sobe the second likewise married in Bethlehem, and was the mother of Elizabeth; last of all the third married in Galilee, and brought forth Mary the mother of Christ. The 19th-century mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich claims that according to her visions (which give a detailed genealogy of Mary), Sobe was a sister of Anne, but the mother of Elizabeth was Emerentia, Sobe and Anne's maternal aunt.\n\nSaint Anne\nAccording to apocryphal Christian and Islamic tradition, Saint Anne was the mother of Mary and the maternal grandmother of Jesus.

He served under President Joseph Estrada, and remained politically loyal to Estrada after Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo rose to power. In 2001, he and Cesar Mancao were charged in connection with the killing of Bubby Dacer, a former public relations official for Joseph Estrada. Aquino then left the Philippines and moved to New York. In March 2005, Aquino was arrested for overstaying his visa. He contacted his friend Leandro Aragoncillo, a Philippine- born security specialist at the White House; however, Aragoncillo's efforts on Aquino's behalf eventually led to Aragoncillo's being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In the course of that investigation, evidence of espionage against the United States Government was uncovered. Aquino was then accused of helping Aragoncillo transmit classified United States documents regarding President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo to her opponents in the Philippines, including both Joseph Estrada and current opposition leader Panfilo Lacson, who had been Aquino's superior in the police force. Under an eventual plea-bargain agreement, Aquino entered a plea of guilty to illegal possession of classified documents, but avoided the more serious charge of espionage that Leandro Aragoncillo received. Aquino faced a jail sentence of between 70 and 87 months plus a$ 250,000 fine. On July 17, 2007, he was sentenced to six years and four months in prison by U.S. District Judge William H. Walls.

However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts.

He usually combined ballads with classical music and was deeply involved in Puerto Rican folk elements and even Andalusian music, as to produce many memorable Latino pop songs which featured elaborate, dramatic lyrics. F\u00e9lix Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Cap\u00f3 was born in Coamo, Puerto Rico to Celso Quiterio Rodr\u00edguez Rivera and Arsenia Cap\u00f3 Canevaro. He adopted \"Bobby\" as his first name and, as Rodr\u00edguez is a common Hispanic surname, he reportedly opted to use his mother's less common one, Cap\u00f3, instead. He then migrated to New York City early in the 1940s. Initially, he replaced Pedro Ortiz D\u00e1vila, \"Davilita\", in a quartet, the Cuarteto Victoria of Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn. He then joined Xavier Cugat's orchestra. Apart from singing, he was also a television host, as well as technical and musical director, and prolific songwriter. He wrote songs for many of his contemporaries. Many of these became hits in Puerto Rico, and occasionally in the rest of Latin America. One of his self-penned songs was \"El Negro Bemb\u00f3n\", a hit for Cortijo y su Combo in the mid-1950s. The song, with local circumstances and character name changed, became \"El Gitano Ant\u00f3n\", a huge hit for Catalan rumba singer Peret in Spain around the mid-1960s. Also, Bobby Capo wrote the score and songs for the movie \"MARUJA\" that was filmed at the end of the 1950s in Puerto Rico. Cap\u00f3's \"Sin FeWithout Faith\"), sometimes known as \"Poquita FeLittle Faith\"), became a proper hit in Puerto Rico when recorded by Felipe Rodr\u00edguez in the mid-1950s, and a huge international hit for Jos\u00e9 Feliciano in the mid-1960s. Cap\u00f3's composition describing his homesickness for Puerto Rico, \"So\u00f1ando con Puerto RicoDreaming of Puerto Rico\"), is revered as an anthem by Puerto Ricans residing abroad. Another of his songs, \"De Las Monta\u00f1as Venimos\" is a Christmas standard in Puerto Rico. His best-known song is \"Piel Canela\" (whose title literally translates to \"Cinnamon Skin\"). He wrote and recorded an English-language version, \"You, Too\", which he most notably recorded in Havana at the request of Rogelio Mart\u00ednez of Sonora Matancera, who asked him to sing pieces of his recently composed songs with his band. Josephine Baker recorded a version in French. The song became the main theme for a Mexican movie of the same name in the late 1950s.

He co-wrote the song\" Lover Man( Oh, Where Can You Be?)\". Davis was born in Madison, Georgia. He and his family moved to Gary, Illinois, and then to Englewood, New Jersey, where he completed his high school education. Being musically gifted, he was accepted into the Juilliard School in New York to study piano and composition, his fees being paid by a benefactress. In the late 1930s or early 1940s he wrote the song\" Lover Man( Oh, Where Can You Be?)\" with Ram Ramirez but could not initially place it, until he offered it to Billie Holiday in 1942. Because of the 1942\u2013 44 musicians' strike Holiday did n't record the song until October 1944, and although at first only a minor hit it soon achieved widespread success and went on to become a jazz standard, recorded by numerous artists including Linda Ronstadt, Barbra Streisand and Petula Clark. During the early 1940s Davis struggled to make a living as a songwriter and supplemented his meagre royalties by giving piano lessons. He was drafted in 1942, but Davis, a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People( NAACP), refused to be enlisted into a segregated regiment and demanded either exemption or service in the nonsegregated Canadian army. After a series of unsuccessful representations to the authorities, which drew press coverage and the support of several public figures, he decided not to report for duty and was imprisoned. His morale and health suffered in prison, as he revealed in letters to the writer and poet Langston Hughes( with whom he would maintain a 25- year correspondence until Hughes died in 1967), and he eventually relented and joined the army. In March 1945, Davis, then an officer attached to an army musical unit, was sent to France for six months, where he registered for a course on French language and culture open to American soldiers at the University of Paris. He wrote to Hughes that Paris\" was exactly what the doctor ordered\". Upon his return to the United States at the end of 1945 he was discharged from the army and left for Hollywood, where he joined the Actors' Laboratory Theatre, taking a course on acting. He tried to pursue a career in acting but was offered only stereotypical racial roles, and at the end of 1947 he emigrated to France. Davis was warmly welcomed in Paris, partly due to the fame of the song\" Lover Man\", and was described by the influential French critic and writer Boris Vian in\" Jazz Hot\" as\" the youngest and most sympathetic of the American composers\". He began to style himself Jimmy\" Lover Man\" Davis and entered a highly creative period, writing a number of songs and placing them with major French performers, such as Yves Montand(\" J'ai de la veine\"), Maurice Chevalier(\" Trinque, trinque[ \u00c0 la tienne]\"), and Jos\u00e9phine Baker(\" You're the Greatest Love\"). His songwriting royalties were still insufficient to live on, so he began singing his own songs in solo performances, touring through France, Italy, Holland, Spain, Switzerland and other countries. In 1957 he released an album,\" Jimmy\" Loverman\" Davis Chante Jimmy\" Loverman\" Davis\", featuring songs all co-written by himself, backed by a quartet that included his friend and fellow expatriate Aaron Bridgers on piano and the French saxophonist Michel de Villers. Apart from his musical work, Davis appeared in plays, including\" Pas de week- end pour un espion\" and\" Des souris et des hommes Of Mice and Men\"), and in the films\" La Putain respectueuse\"( 1952, uncredited),\" M\u00e9lodie en sous- sol Any Number Can Win\")( 1962, as Sam), and\" Je t' aime moi non plus\"( 1976, as Mo\u00efse).

Mickey is on exhibition at a 400 m2 habitat and as of June 2009, was two years old and weighed 180 kg (400 lb). Attempts to verify this report have been bolstered by recent images purported to show the adult Mickey (see External links section). There has been no report of the birth of a healthy hybrid from a male jaguar and female tiger, which would be termed a \"jagger\".There is a claimed sighting of a lion \u00d7 black jaguar cross (male) and a tiger \u00d7 black jaguar cross (female) loose in Maui, Hawaii. There are no authenticated tiger/jaguar hybrids and the description matches that of a liger. The alleged tiger \u00d7 black jaguar was large, relatively long necked (probably due to lack of a ruff or mane) with both stripes and \"jaguar-like\" rosettes on its sides. The assertion of hybrid identity was due to the combination of black, dark brown, light brown, dark orange, dark yellow and beige markings and the tiger-like stripes radiating from its face. It is more likely to have been a released liger since these are very large and have a mix of rosettes (lion juvenile markings) and stripes and can have a brindled mix of colours exactly as described (their markings are extremely variable).\n\nHistory of Jacksonville, Florida\nIn 1513, Spanish explorers landed in Florida and claimed their discovery for Spain (see Spanish Florida). The first Europeans to visit the area were Spanish missionaries and explorers from this period. In February 1562, French naval officer Jean Ribault and a 150 settlers arrived seeking land for a safe haven for the French Huguenots, Protestants suffering religious persecution in France. Ribault explored the mouth of the St. Johns River before moving north and establishing the colony of Charlesfort on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina. Ribault returned to France for supplies, but tensions from French Wars of Religion had broken out during his absence. His return to Florida was delayed as a result. Without leadership or provisions, the colonists abandoned Charlesfort. In 1564 Ribault's former lieutenant, Ren\u00e9 Goulaine de Laudonni\u00e8re, launched a new expedition to found a colony on the St. Johns River. On June 22, 1564, the settlers established Fort Caroline atop the St. Johns Bluff.\n\nYou and the Night and the Music (Mal Waldron album)\nYou and the Night and the Music is an album by American jazz pianist Mal Waldron recorded in 1983 and released by the Japanese Paddle Wheel label.\n\nRoss Reynolds (rugby union)\nRoss John Reynolds( born 27 September 1958 in Orange) is a former Australian rugby union player, coach and businessman.\n\nWhich film has the director who died later, Akhono Onek Raat or Bitter Rice?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

The term\" hip hop studies\" began circulating in the mid-2000s, and though it is not clear who first coined the term to label the field, the field of hip hop studies is oft cited as having been crystallized by the publication of\" That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader\" in 2003. \" That's the Joint!\" includes approximately 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism. The publication of this anthology was unprecedented, and highlights the evolving and continuous influence of\" one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s.\" The publication of the first edition of\" That's the Joint!\" marked a consolidating moment for the field of hip hop studies because it brought together key writings on hip hop from a diversity of hip hop authorities. Hip hop culture, rooted in the 1970s post -industrial South Bronx, is polyvocal and is represented in five cultural modes: rap music( oral), turntablism or\" DJing\"( aural), breaking( physical), graffiti art( visual), and knowledge( mental). Hip hop has, and continues to produce a remarkable array of thinkers who embody complex ideological makeups exemplified through their performances as writers, artists, poets, and scholars. In\" Hip Hop Matters\"( 2005), professor and media scholar S. Craig Watkins labels the increasing interdisciplinary cohort of hip hop academics and scholars as the\" hip- hop intelligentsia,\" and suggests that while this group of individuals may not often been discussed as an entity in and of itself, their existence is, without question, one of the greatest achievements of the hip hop movement. Watkins writes:\" The growing array of hip- hop intellectuals is a spectacular indication of the movement's multifaceted demeanor and ceaseless energy ... What has emerged is a body of thinkers who articulate a wide range of ideas that, in their unique way, map out the contradictory currents, ideas, and worldview that percolate throughout the phenomenal world of hip hop. From spoken- word artists to academic scholars hip- hop intellectuals are translating the movement into a vast mix of critical commentary and artistic expression. The results both energize and expand the image and imagination of the hip- hop intelligentsia.\" Hip hop studies is part of the larger hip hop movement. The research and teaching in this interdisciplinary field includes analyses of technology, pop culture, linguistics, globalization, geography, race, electoral politics, and a variety of aspects related to contemporary culture, as scholars attempt to critically assess hip hop as a movement. Scholarship in hip hop studies is rooted in the foundational, Afro-diasporic call- and- response mechanism within hip hop culture.\n\nHenry II, Margrave of Meissen\nHenry II( 1103 \u2013 1123) was the Margrave of Meissen and the Saxon Ostmark( as\" Lusizensis marchio\": margrave of Lusatia) from his birth until his death.

He was the second Meissener margrave of the House of Wettin. He was initially under the regency of his great uncle Thimo. He died young and without children in 1123.

The British Military Administration also disapproved of Sultan Ali's character, where he was said to have repudiated his official consort Tengku Putri Hajjah \u2018 Ain ul- Jamal,\" Tengku Sri Nila Utama\" of Pahang( the daughter of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang) and had contracted an unsuitable second marriage to a former prostitute.

Brodie's depiction of Joseph Smith in 1945 as a fraudulent \"genius of improvisation\" has been described as both a \"beautifully written biography ... the work of a mature scholar [that] represented the first genuine effort to come to grips with the contradictory evidence about Smith's early life\" and as a work that presented conjecture as fact. Her best-selling psychobiography of Thomas Jefferson, published in 1974, was the first serious study to examine evidence related to accounts that he had taken his slave Sally Hemings as a concubine.

The \"Smithsonian\" magazine named Ellen G. White among the \"100 Most Significant Americans of All Time. White claimed to have received over 2,000 visions and dreams from God in public and private meetings throughout her life, which were witnessed by Adventist pioneers and the general public. She verbally described and published for public consumption the content of the alleged visions. The Adventist pioneers viewed these experiences as the Biblical gift of prophecy as outlined in and which describe the testimony of Jesus as the \"spirit of prophecy.\" Her \"Conflict of the Ages\" series of writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in Biblical history and in church history. This cosmic conflict, referred to by Seventh-day Adventist theologians as the \"Great Controversy theme,\" became foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Her book on successful Christian living, \"Steps to Christ\", has been published in more than 140 languages. The book Child Guidance, a compilation of her writings about child care, training and education, has been used as the foundation for the Seventh-day Adventist school system. White was considered a controversial figure by her critics, with much of the controversy centering on her reports of visionary experiences and on the use of other sources in her writings. Historian Randall Balmer has described White as \"one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion\". Walter Martin described her as \"one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the horizon of religious history\". Arthur L. White, her grandson and biographer, writes that Ellen G. White is the most translated female non-fiction author in the history of literature, as well as the most translated American non-fiction author of either gender. Her writings covered a broad range of subjects, including religion, social relationships, prophecy, publishing, nutrition, creationism, agriculture, theology, evangelism, Christian lifestyle, education, and health. She advocated vegetarianism. She promoted and has been instrumental in the establishment of schools and medical centers all over the world, with the most renown being the Andrews University in Michigan and the Loma Linda University and Medical Center in California. During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and 40 books. more than 200 White titles are available in English, including compilations from her 100,000 pages of manuscript published by the Ellen G.
