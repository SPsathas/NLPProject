Morgan\nEphraim Franklin Morgan (January 16, 1869January 15, 1950) was born on a farm near Forksburg, Marion County, West Virginia, a descendant of the first white settler of western Virginia, Morgan Morgan, and his son David Morgan. He studied at Fairmont State Normal School and graduated from the West Virginia University law school in 1897. After establishing a law practice in Fairmont, Morgan enlisted in the First West Virginia Infantry during the Spanish\u2013American War. Following the war, he became the Fairmont city attorney. He served as a judge of the Marion County Intermediate Court from 1907 to 1912 and as a member of the West Virginia Public Service Commission from 1915 to 1920. In 1902, he married Alma Bennett. At the time Morgan became governor, a virtual state of war existed between union coal miners and coal operators. The United Mine Workers union was protesting for the right to organize miners in the southwestern part of the state. In late summer 1921, the governor called upon President Warren G. Harding to dispatch federal troops to end an armed miners' march in Boone and Logan counties. After the conflict ended, Morgan used National Guard troops to discourage miners from again taking up arms. A more detailed discussion of the 1921 armed miners' march and the Battle of Blair Mountain can be found in Clayton D. Laurie's \"The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920\u20131921\" in \"West Virginia History\", Volume 50 (1991). Under Morgan, the legislature created a sinking fund to provide financial assistance to new programs, namely a new road system. He appointed a Capitol Commission to devise a plan for replacing the old state capitol, which was destroyed by fire on January 3, 1921. The west wing of the present state capitol was completed in 1925. One week before leaving office, Ephraim and Alma Morgan became the first residents of the present West Virginia Governor's Mansion. After his term as governor, Morgan served as solicitor for the United States Department of Commerce before retiring in Fairmont, West Virginia. In 1940, he was defeated for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. He died in Bethesda, Maryland, on January 15, 1950, one day before his 81st birthday.\n\nWhich film has the producer who was born earlier, Term Life or Housefull 2?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

By the time the first subway opened, the lines had been consolidated into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn -- Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). Many present lines were built under the Dual Contracts, and after 1913, all lines built for the IRT and most other lines built or improved for the BRT were built by the city and leased to the companies. The first line of the city - owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended to compete with the private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down. However, it was kept within the core of the city because of the low amount of startup capital provided to the municipal Board of Transportation by the state. This required it to be run ``at cost '', necessitating fares up to double the five - cent fare popular at the time.\n\nSave the Green Planet!\nSave the Green Planet!

Rather, one electron accumulates on the negative plate for each one that leaves the positive plate, resulting in an electron depletion and consequent positive charge on one electrode that is equal and opposite to the accumulated negative charge on the other. Thus the charge on the electrodes is equal to the integral of the current as well as proportional to the voltage, as discussed above. As with any antiderivative, a constant of integration is added to represent the initial voltage V(t0). This is the integral form of the capacitor equation:\n\nLeague of Nations\nFollowing a long record of instigating localised conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937.

One of the most prominent incidents during Yejong's reign was the trial and death of General Nam I (\ub0a8\uc774 \uc7a5\uad70, \u5357\u6021). Nam-I was famous for having suppressed Yi Si-ae rebellion along with General Gang-Sun and others. At age 28, he was appointed to Minister of War.

At the same time, other violent conflicts took place in the south of China where the Communist Party fielded superior numbers and were massacring Nationalist supporters. These events eventually led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party. Chiang Kai - shek pushed the Communist Party into the interior as he sought to destroy them, and moved the Nationalist Government to Nanjing in 1927. Leftists within the KMT still allied to the communists, lead by Wang Jingwei, had established a rival Nationalist Government in Wuhan two months earlier, but soon joined Chiang in Nanjing in August 1927.

She is considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first country music artists to successfully crossover into pop music. Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country and Western Sides chart. Cline's first professional performances began at the local WINC radio station when she was fifteen. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on Connie B. Gay's \"Town and Country\" television broadcasts. It also led to the signing of her first recording contract with the Four Star label in 1954. She had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including \"A Church, A Courtroom and Goodbye\" (1955) and \"I've Loved and Lost Again\" (1956). In 1957 however, Cline made her first national television appearance on \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\". After performing \"Walkin' After Midnight\", the single would become her first major hit on both the country and pop charts. Cline's further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. After marrying in 1957 and giving birth in 1958, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline would become a member of the Grand Ole Opry and then move to Decca Records in 1960. Under the direction of producer Owen Bradley, her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single \"I Fall to Pieces\" would become her first to top the \"Billboard\" country chart. As the song became a hit, Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After recovering, her next single release \"Crazy\" would also become a major hit. Between 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with \" She's Got YouWhen I Get Through with YouSo Wrong\" and \"Leavin' on Your Mind\". She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. In March 1963, Cline appeared at a benefit show in Kansas City, Missouri. To return home, she boarded a plane along with country performers Cowboy Copas, Hawkshaw Hawkins and manager Randy Hughes. Upon hitting rough weather, the plane crashed outside of Camden, Tennessee, killing all those on board. Since her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres. She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In the 1980s, Cline's posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic \"Sweet Dreams\" starring Jessica Lange. Several documentaries and stage shows were released during this time, including the 1988 musical \" Always... Patsy Cline\". A 1991 box set of her recordings was issued that received critical acclaim. Her greatest hits album sold over 10 million copies in 2005.

It is among the earliest extant log churches in Hampshire County, along with Capon Chapel and Mount Bethel Church. The church was constructed in 1838 to serve as a nondenominational\" union church\". As many of the Mill Creek valley's earliest settlers were of German descent, Old Pine Church may also have been built as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents, known as\" Dunkers\" or\" Dunkards\". The church is believed to have also been a meeting place for German Methodist settlers. By 1870, the church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination, and in 1878, the church's congregation split into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church congregations. Both congregations continued to use the church until 1907. Old Pine Church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship. In 1968, residents of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to perform a restoration of the church. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, due to its\" significant settlement- era rural religious architecture in the Potomac Highlands.\" The church is a large, one- story, gablefront log building sheathed in brown- painted wooden German siding. The original hewn log beams are visible beneath the church, with some bark remaining on the logs. The church's interior ceiling measures approximately in height and is clad in pressed metal panels. Several of its pews date from 1857. In the church's adjoining cemetery, the earliest extant gravestone dates from 1834, and several unmarked interment sites may exist from as early as 1759. According to architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi,\" Old Pine Church and cemetery is an excellent example of one of the area's early rural church complexes.\"\n\nTranscendence (2012 film)\nTranscendence( \u8d85\u8d8a\u90a3\u4e00\u5929\" ch\u0101oyu\u00e8 n\u00e0 y\u012bti\u0101n\") is a 2012 3 D concert film and documentary on the\" Father of Chinese Rock\" Cui Jian.

His work as a director includes \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" (1995) , \"Mohabbatein\" (2000), \"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\" (2008) and \"Befikre\" (2016). He is also the current Chairman of India's multi-national film, media and entertainment conglomerate Yash Raj Films (YRF). Chopra has written and produced a number of films under the banner such as \"Veer-Zaara\" (2004), \"Fanaa\" (2006), \"Band Baaja Baaraat\" (2010), \" Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" (2012), the \"Dhoom series\" (2004, 2006 & 2013), \"Sultan\" (2016), the \"Tiger series\" (2012 & 2017) and \"War\" (2019). He has broken away from typecast through production of off-beat films such as \"Kabul Express\" (2006), \"Chak De! India\" (2007),  (2009) , \"Dum Laga Ke Haisha\" (2015) and \"Hichki!\" (2018), that do not necessarily fit into the realm of \"masala films\". Chopra is also the first to move towards a true film studio model through independent projects helmed by talent under his banner. Major post-production work of the company is now carried out of YRF Studios (co-founded by his ex-wife Payal Khanna), where Chopra serves as Chief Executive. He has produced ten films that have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of more than 200 crore, which is the most for an Indian film producer. In December 2009, Chopra fought a hostile acquisition bid by Walt Disney, valued upwards of 2500 crore, to remain and continue purely as a domestic entity aided by the Tata Sons. Apart from emerging as an equitable brand, his company has earned the status of a movie mogul through distribution networks spread across the globe, estimated to be net worth 7640 crore (FY17/18) by the NSE, thereby making it the biggest and most successful film production company in the history of Indian Cinema. Having denied him admission into the NSD as a young applicant, the Directorate of Film Festivals eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2005, 2007 and 2015. The Government of India appealed both Chopra and Mani Ratnam to focus on content created locally under its Make in India initiative, which was later followed by productions like \"Daawat-e-Ishq\" (2014), \"Meri Pyaari Bindu\" (2016), \"Sui-Dhaaga\" (2018) and \"Jayeshbhai Jordaar\" (2020) planned by his company. In June 2018, he was awarded membership into The Academy by the Producers Guild of America. Widely regarded as one of the most influential and powerful executives in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra's son and the Chief Executive of Yash Raj Films. He has remained extremely media-shy and a passive individual, battling constant reports of an alleged dysthymic disorder throughout his three-decade career, resulting in very few public photos of him being in existence.\n\nWhich film came out earlier, Rajapart Rangadurai or At Sword'S Edge?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

A self- described\" able C man\", Fackenthal graduated from Boys High School in 1902 before earning his undergraduate degree from Columbia College in 1906. As a student, his prodigious administrative abilities( reflected by his leadership in various campus organizations, including the Varsity Show and the\" Columbia Daily Spectator\") were recognized by president Nicholas Murray Butler, leading to his career as chief clerk( 1906 \u2013 1910), secretary( 1910 \u2013 1937), and provost( 1937 \u2013 1948) of the University. As secretary and provost, he was the\" de facto\" administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes from their inception until 1948; following his retirement, he received a special Prize in recognition of his service. Previously, Fackenthal received an honorary LL.D. from Franklin& Marshall College( a recipient of familial philanthropy) and an honorary Litt.D. from Columbia in 1929. Although he never completed an earned graduate degree, he was frequently characterized in the press thereafter as\" Dr. Fackenthal.\" He later received honorary doctorates from Syracuse University, Rutgers University, New York University and Union College. Between the retirement of Nicholas Murray Butler in 1945 and the installation of Dwight D. Eisenhower as president in 1948, Fackenthal served as acting president while retaining his post as provost. Although several trustees considered motioning for his permanent appointment, this was forestalled by the ailing Butler, who considered Fackenthal( whom he publicly deprecated as\" my clerk\") to be unworthy of the position. Despite this acrimony, Fackenthal was elected to the university's board of trustees against Butler's wishes in 1946 in an unprecedented breach of longstanding tradition. As acting president, Fackenthal developed a plan for Columbia's continued growth that was\" largely eschewed by his successors\", presaging the tumult of Grayson Kirk's administration and the Columbia University protests of 1968. He also oversaw the formation of the School of General Studies( for nontraditional undergraduates and nonmatriculated students), the graduate- level School of International Affairs and the Harriman Institute. Following his retirement from the University in 1948, he served as educational consultant to the Carnegie Corporation( 1948 \u2013 1952) and then as president of Columbia University Press( 1953 \u2013 1958). He also served as president of the Bushwick Savings Bank and remained a trustee of various institutions, including Columbia, Barnard College, Franklin and Marshall College and the Riverdale Country School. His principal speeches as acting president were published by Columbia University Press as\" The Greater Power and Other Addresses\"( 1949). In December 1965, he was critically injured when his car collided with a truck in White Township, New Jersey, 35 miles south of his country home in Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania. As a result of his injuries, Fackenthal( who never married and had no legitimate children) was forced to permanently relocate from Brooklyn to Buck Hill Falls.

On 23 January 1521 she married Fran\u00e7ois de la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, \"vicomte\" de Thouars. The marriage not only brought the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles the countship of Laval and the Neapolitan claim in 1521, but also the rank of \"princes \u00e9trangers\" at the French court.

As daughter and sole heir to Guy XII de Laval, Anne was \"dame de Laval\", and one of the conditions of the marriage was that any children born to it would bear the name and arms of the House of Laval. (The same condition had already been applied to the marriage of Emma de Laval with Mathieu II de Montmorency.) Nevertheless, Jean de Montfort renounced the name and title he had been born with to take up the name of Guy XIII de Laval, better to associate himself with his wife Anne's power.
