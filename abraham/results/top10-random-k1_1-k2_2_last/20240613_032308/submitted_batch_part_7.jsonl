The story of the Bull of Heaven has two different versions: one recorded in an earlier Sumerian poem and a later version in the standard Akkadian\" Epic of Gilgamesh\". In the Sumerian poem, the Bull is sent to attack Gilgamesh by the goddess Inanna for reasons that are unclear. The more complete Akkadian account comes from Tablet VI of the\" Epic of Gilgamesh\", in which Gilgamesh rejects the sexual advances of the goddess Ishtar, the East Semitic equivalent of Inanna, leading the enraged Ishtar to demand her father Anu for the Bull of Heaven, so that she may send it to attack Gilgamesh in Uruk. Anu gives her the Bull and she sends it to attack Gilgamesh and his companion, the hero Enkidu, who slay the Bull together. After defeating the Bull, Enkidu hurls the Bull's right thigh at Ishtar, taunting her. The slaying of the Bull results in the gods condemning Enkidu to death, an event which catalyzes Gilgamesh's fear for his own death, which drives the remaining portion of the epic. The Bull was identified with the constellation Taurus and the myth of its slaying may have held astronomical significance to the ancient Mesopotamians. Aspects of the story have been compared to later tales from the ancient Near East, including legends from Ugarit, the tale of Joseph in the Book of Genesis, and parts of the ancient Greek epics, the\" Iliad\" and the\" Odyssey\".\n\nChonghai Bridge\nChonghai Bridge () is a bridge, located at , spanning the northern distributary of the Yangtze River in China that is currently under construction.

He is an early pioneer of independent cinema.

At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival which garnered the film worldwide commercial success, among numerous accolades. His breakthrough saw him to Hollywood where he directed crime comedy \"Out of Sight\" (1998); biopic \"Erin Brockovich\" (2000) and crime drama film \"Traffic\" (2000), the latter winning him the Academy Award for Best Director. He found further popular and critical success with the \"Ocean's\" trilogy and film franchise (2001\u201318); \"Contagion\" (2011); \"Magic Mike\" (2012); \"Side Effects\" (2013); \"Logan Lucky\" (2017); and \"Unsane\" (2018). Despite his film career spanning a multitude of genres, his cinematic niche centers on psychological, crime, and heist thrillers. His films have grossed over US$2.2 billion worldwide and garnered nine Oscar nominations, winning seven. Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts often used for big budget Hollywood movies but with an avant garde arthouse approach to them. They center on the themes of shifting personal identities, vengeance, sexuality, morality, and the human condition. His feature films retain distinctive cinematography as a result of his liberal use of avant-garde cinema coupled with unconventional film and camera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines with plot twists, nonlinear storytelling, experimental sequencing, suspenseful soundscapes, and third person vantage points. Uniquely, he often serves as his own director of photography and editor under the respective pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard.\n\nThe Vice Squad\nThe Vice Squad is a 1931 American Pre- Code drama film directed by John Cromwell, written by Oliver H.P.

Scullin led Labor to government at the 1929 election. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 transpired just two days after his swearing in, which would herald the beginning of the Great Depression in Australia. Scullin's administration would soon be overwhelmed by the economic crisis, with interpersonal and policy disagreements causing a three- way split of his party that would bring down the government in late 1931. Despite his chaotic term of office, Scullin remained a leading figure in the Labor movement throughout his lifetime, and served as an\" \u00e9minence grise\" in various capacities for the party until his retirement in 1949. The son of working- class Irish- immigrants, Scullin spent much of his early life as a laborer and grocer in Ballarat. An autodidact and passionate debater, Scullin would join the Australian Labor Party in 1903, beginning a career spanning five decades. He was a political organizer and newspaper editor for the party, and was elected to the House of Representatives first in 1910 and then again in 1922 until 1949. Scullin quickly established himself as a leading voice in parliament, rapidly rising to become deputy leader of the party in 1927 and then Leader of the Opposition in 1928. After Scullin had won a landslide election in 1929, events took a dramatic change with the crisis on Wall Street and the rapid onset of the Great Depression around the world, which hit heavily indebted Australia hard. Scullin and his Treasurer Ted Theodore responded by developing several plans during 1930 and 1931 to repay foreign debt, provide relief to farmers and create economic stimulus to curb unemployment based on deficit spending and expansionary monetary policy. Although the Keynesian Revolution would see these ideas adopted by most Western nations by the end of the decade, in 1931 such ideas were considered radical and the plans were bitterly opposed by many who feared hyperinflation and economic ruin. The still opposition- dominated Senate, and the conservative- dominated boards of the Commonwealth Bank and Loan Council, repeatedly blocked the plans. With the prospect of bankruptcy facing the government, Scullin backed down and instead advanced the Premiers' Plan, a far more conservative measure that met the crisis with severe cutbacks in government spending. Pensioners and other core Labor constituencies were severely affected by the cuts, leading to a widespread revolt and multiple defections in parliament. After several months of infighting the government collapsed, and was resoundingly defeated by the newly formed United Australia Party at the subsequent 1931 election. Scullin would remain party leader for four more years but the party split would not be healed until after Scullin's return to the backbenches in 1935. Scullin became a respected elder voice within the party and leading authority on taxation and government finance, and would eventually play a significant role in reforming both when Labor returned to government in 1941. Although disappointed with his own term of office, he nonetheless lived long enough to see many of his government's ideas implemented by subsequent governments before his death in 1953.\n\nGuido Seeber\nGuido Seeber (22 June 1879 in Chemnitz \u2013 2 July 1940 in Berlin) was a German cinematographer and pioneer of early cinema.\n\nEdward Leech (MP)\nSir Edward Leech or Leche( 1572 \u2013 1652) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1614 and 1625.\n\nThe Legend of Paul and Paula\nDie Legende von Paul und Paula (English: \" The Legend of Paul and Paula\") is a 1973 tragicomic East German film directed by Heiner Carow.

Her name in Greek translates to \" Athenais the loving one\". The child of King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his second marriage to the Anatolian Greek Macedonian noblewoman and Pontian Queen Monime, she was a princess of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. Born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontos, her parents gave her a traditional ancient Greek name. Athenais married the Cappadocian Prince and later King Ariobarzanes II Philopator, who was of Persian and Greek descent. Ariobarzanes II succeeded his father as King in 63 BC-62 BC, when his father Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios abdicated his throne. When Ariobarzanes II became king, Athenais became Cappadocian queen, inheriting the honorific title of \"Philostorgos\", which was the honorific surname of the mother of Ariobarzanes II, Athenais Philostorgos I. Athenais was related to the previous kings and monarchs of Cappadocia. Her paternal aunt Laodice of Cappadocia was a queen, her paternal cousins, Ariarathes VI, Ariarathes VII, and Ariarathes VIII, and her paternal half-brother Ariarathes IX all served as previous kings of Cappadocia. Through her Seleucid and paternal lineage, Athenais was related to the ancestors of Ariarathes VI. Ariobarzanes II reigned as king of Cappadocia from c. 63 BC-62 BC until his assassination in c. 51 BC. There are various surviving honorific inscriptions dedicated to Athenais. During their marriage, Athenais bore Ariobarzanes II two sons: Ariobarzanes III Eusebes Philoromaios and Ariarathes X Eusebes Philadelphos. Her sons would serve as among the last kings of Cappadocia. The name \"Ariobarzanes\" was not only a name from her husband's family, but also a name from her own family. Athenais had three paternal political ancestors of that name: Ariobarzanes of Phrygia, who flourished 5th century BC, Ariobarzanes II of Cius, who flourished 4th century BC, and the previous Pontian King Ariobarzanes of Pontus. After the death of her husband, her first son succeeded his father as King and she became a widow who never married again. Athenais became known as the \u2018Queen-Mother\u2019 of Cappadocia. During the rule of Ariobarzanes III, Roman Governor of Cilicia Marcus Tullius Cicero warned the King that Athenais could be a potential enemy to him. Cicero's warning was based on Athenais\u2019 jealousy, about two nobles called Methras and Athenaeus. They were ministers and favorites of her first son and they were through Athenais\u2019 jealousy were driven out from the Cappadocian Royal Court. However, Methras and Athenaeus were later recalled by Cicero. Athenais\u2019 jealousy was a part of her failed plot to depose her first son from his throne and put her second son in his place. Cicero and Ariobarzanes III caught Athenais out and Ariobarzanes III was very saddened by his mother's actions. Ariabarzanes III removed his mother from power and her fate afterward is unknown.\n\nWhat a Diff'rence a Day Made\n``What a Diff'rence a Day Makes ''Single by Dinah Washington from the album What a Diff'rence a Day Makes!

It was only on 31 December 1847 that Ad\u00e9lina married her long-time companion Emperor Faustin. On 26 August 1849 she was given the title Empress of Haiti with the style of Her Imperial Majesty, and crowned with her husband at the capital Port-au-Prince on 18 April 1852: both emperor and empress were crowned in an immense and lavish ceremony that emulated the coronation of the French Napoleon I of France. Her sister was styled Her Serene Highness Princess Cl\u00e9lia. They had two daughters: As Empress, Adelina was given her own court, composed of a grand almoner, two ladies of honor, two tirewomen, 56 ladies of the palace, 22 ladies of the chapel, chamberlains and pages: all the female courtiers came from the newly appointed nobility of Faustin and had the titles duchess, countess, baroness or marchioness. She performed representational duties, such as receiving in state, or giving audiences, every Tuesday. In 1858 a revolution began, led by General Fabre Geffrard, Duc de Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country. As a result, the emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation , Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859. Soon afterwards, the emperor and his family arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, where they remained for several years.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\"\n\nA Daughter of Two Worlds\nA Daughter of Two Worlds is a surviving 1920 silent film adventure drama directed by James Young and starring Norma Talmadge, Jack Crosby, and Virginia Lee.\n\nWhere did the director of film A Daughter Of Two Worlds die?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Its standard designation is \"Codex a\" (or 3 in the Beuron system of numeration). The order of the gospels in this Codex is Matthew, John, Luke and Mark, which is also found in some other very old \"Western\" manuscripts, such as Codex Bezae. In its text of Matthew 3, before verse 16, there is a statement that a light suddenly shone when Jesus was baptized (Et cum baptizaretur, lumen ingens circumfulsit de aqua, ita ut timerent omnes qui advenerant). It contains the last twelve verses of the Gospel of Mark, but on a replacement-page. The original final pages after Mark 15:15 have been lost, and the replacement-page resumes mid-sentence in 16:7 and includes the text to the end of verse 20, but in the Vulgate version. Space considerations suggest that it is unlikely that the original, non-extant pages included verses 9-20, but this calculation (made by C. H. Turner in 1928) depends on unverifiable assumptions that only four pages have been lost, that the scribe did not accidentally skip any text, and that the person who made the replacement-page had access to the missing page that it replaced. However Turner did not explain why a scribe would replace only one of four pages. It is more probable that the replacement-page was removed from another manuscript than that it was made to insert in Codex Vercellensis.
