Doris Hopp
Doris Hopp (16 July 1930 ‚Äì 31 October 1998) was a Swedish brothel madam who organized a network of call girls in Stockholm, Sweden, in the early 1970s. She was arrested on pimping charges in 1976. A police investigation soon revealed that many of Hopp's customers were well-known politicians and other dignitaries. In November 1977, the newspaper ""Dagens Nyheter"" published allegations citing Justice Minister Lennart Geijer as one of Doris Hopp's customers. The newspaper claimed as its source a classified report in which the chief of police Carl Persson had informed Prime Minister Olof Palme of the involvement of politicians in the prostitution scandal. At the time of the scandal broke, it was legal to pay for sexual services, but the fact that politicians socialized with prostitutes was viewed as a security risk as staff from foreign embassies were also reported to frequent the brothel. Prime Minister Palme strongly denied the allegations, accusing the newspaper of aggravated libel. The newspaper was forced into a retreat and two days after the publication Lennart Geijer received an official apology. Years later, it emerged that a few minor details aside, the newspaper's assertions had in fact been largely correct. Over the years, there has been much speculation regarding the identities of those who made use of the brothel's services. Former Prime Minister Thorbj√∂rn F√§lldin and former Centre Party leader Olof Johansson have both publicly denied frequenting Doris Hopp's brothel.

Middle name
In several cultures, a middle name is a portion of a personal name that is written between the person's given name and their surname. A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called middle names. In English- speaking American culture, that term is often applied( arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a"" middle name"", and is actually( to mention several types of common cases): In the United States, such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, patronymics, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the"" middle name"" is often abbreviated to the middle initial( e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for signatures) or omitted entirely in everyday use( e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings. It is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English- speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century( and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender James Francis Edward Stuart( 1688 ‚Äì 1766). Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase"" middle name"" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical"" Harvardiana"". The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently by the increased use of computer databases that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such databases under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like Mar√≠a del Pilar Pereyra or Mar√≠a de las Nieves Garc√≠a. The abbreviation"" N.M.N.""( no middle name) or"" N.M.I.""( no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name. Since 1905,"" middle name"" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase"" discretion is my middle name.""

"" Trouble"" is a song written by the English singer- songwriter and musician, Cat Stevens, during a period from 1969 to 1970. Stevens was recovering during what amounted to nearly a year of convalescence, after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung and tuberculosis. He spent three months in King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, England, transferring afterward to another nine months of bedrest at home. Stevens, who was near death at the time he was admitted in the hospital, used the time he was recuperating for contemplation, and wrote dozens of songs, including"" Trouble"", many of which were recorded much later. When he was hospitalized, Stevens was often alone in a very spare and plain room. He was told that at the time he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him. The effect on the 19- year- old pop star was pronounced. He said,"" To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut."" The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folk- rock emphasis. While recovering, Stevens donated his spare time, and some of his newer, more introspective songs for Colin Higgins and Hal Ashby's 1971 film soundtrack of"" Harold and Maude"". Most of the tunes used for the movie appear on Stevens's next albums,"" Mona Bone Jakon"" and"" Tea for the Tillerman"", with the exception of two songs which were not released until the release of the album in 1984,"" If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out"" and"" Do n't Be Shy"". In"" Harold and Maude"" the song"" Trouble"" is used in the scene of Maude's impending death, with her devoted young lover heartbroken over the turn of events.

In 2003, just days before her death, the Institute awarded her an honorary degree. To make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to ""Nina Simone"" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play ""the devil's music"" or so-called ""cocktail piano"".

Hip hop, or hip - hop, is a subculture and art movement developed in the Bronx in New York City during the late 1970s. The origins of the word are often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx. While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music (also called rap), hip hop is characterized by nine elements, of which only four elements are considered essential to understand hip - hop musically. The main elements of hip - hop consist of four main pillars. Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture, coining the terms: ``rapping ''(also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural / sound and music creation); b - boying / b - girling / breakdancing (movement / dance); and graffiti art. Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual / philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others. The fifth element is commonly considered either street knowledge, hip hop fashion or beatboxing however it is often debated.

Research suggests that sexual orientation is independent of cultural and other social influences, but that open identification of one's sexual orientation may be hindered by homophobic/hetereosexist settings. Social systems such as religion, language and ethnic traditions can have a powerful impact on realization of sexual orientation. Influences of culture may complicate the process of measuring sexual orientation. The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-class, well-educated samples, however there are pockets of research that document various other cultural groups, although these are frequently limited in diversity of gender and sexual orientation of the subjects. Integration of sexual orientation with sociocultural identity may be a challenge for LGBT individuals. Individuals may or may not consider their sexual orientation to define their sexual identity, as they may experience various degrees of fluidity of sexuality, or may simply identify more strongly with another aspect of their identity such as family role. American culture puts a great emphasis on individual attributes, and views the self as unchangeable and constant. In contrast, East Asian cultures put a great emphasis on a person's social role within social hierarchies, and view the self as fluid and malleable. These differing cultural perspectives have many implications on cognitions of the self, including perception of sexual orientation.

b3d918160bdd11eba7f7acde48001122,Australian Sports Commentator,Nine Network,"Capacitor
For air dielectric capacitors the breakdown field strength is of the order 2 to 5 MV/m; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 MV/m; for oil, 15 to 25 MV/m; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric. The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy.

During the 1940s, Block was considered one of America's best comedy writers, having worked for many of the top comedians of the era, such as Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, Martin and Lewis, Milton Berle and Burns and Allen and in all major media, including radio, Hollywood movies, Broadway and print.

With a panel previously consisting of journalists, a politician and a poet, reviewers had criticized the show as bland. After a rocky start,"" What's My Line?"" became one of the top- rated shows on television. Critics praised his work; the"" Chicago Sun- Times"" called Block the"" freshest new personality in TV."" However, his humor could be risqu√©, which antagonized some conservative 1950s viewers. He once risked the sponsor's wrath, referring to their deodorant with the line"" Make your armpit a charmpit."" In early 1953, Block was suspended and then fired. He left show business for the investment business a few years later, while"" What's My Line?"" continued on as a staple of Sunday night television for another 14 years.

Endangered Species Act of 1973
Opponents of the Endangered Species Act argue that with over 2,000 endangered species listed, and only 28 delisted due to recovery, the success rate of 1% over nearly three decades proves that there needs to be serious reform in their methods to actually help the endangered animals and plants. Others argue that the ESA may encourage preemptive habitat destruction by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species; known colloquially as ""Shoot, Shovel and Shut-Up."" One example of such perverse incentives is the case of a forest owner who, in response to ESA listing of the red-cockaded woodpecker, increased harvesting and shortened the age at which he harvests his trees to ensure that they do not become old enough to become suitable habitat. While no studies have shown that the Act's negative effects, in total, exceed the positive effects, many economists believe that finding a way to reduce such perverse incentives would lead to more effective protection of endangered species.

The Yablanski House was built in 1906-1907 to the designs of Austro-Hungarian architect Friedrich Gr√ºnanger (1856‚Äì1929) on the order of the wealthy financier and former mayor of Sofia Dimitar Yablanski (1859‚Äì1924). The exterior decoration was the work of the royal decorator of the Bulgarian Royal Family, Andreas Greis. Architecturally, the house was designed in the Baroque style with some Renaissance elements, with the interior stucco done in the Rococo style. The mansard floor is an important feature of the house's artistic design, together with the balcony railings of wrought iron and the several female sculptures. The furniture and the materials were specially supplied from Vienna. The house's architecture draws heavily from an earlier work of Gr√ºnanger's, the Royal Palace in Sofia. Notably, the architect's home in Salzburg, where he later moved and subsequently died, is almost identical to the Yablanski House.

Shoshenq III
King Usermaatre Setepenre/ Setepenamun Shoshenq III ruled Egypt's 22nd Dynasty for 39 years according to contemporary historical records. Two Apis Bulls were buried in the fourth and 28th years of his reign and he celebrated his Heb Sed Jubilee in his regnal year 30. Little is known of the precise basis for his successful claim to the throne since he was not a son of Osorkon II and Shoshenq's parentage and family ties are unknown. From Shoshenq III's eighth regnal year, his reign was marked by the loss of Egypt's political unity, with the appearance of Pedubast I at Thebes. Henceforth, the kings of the 22nd Dynasty only controlled Lower Egypt. The Theban High Priest Osorkon B( the future Osorkon III) did date his activities at Thebes and( Upper Egypt) to Shoshenq III's reign, but this was solely for administrative reasons since Osorkon did not declare himself king after the death of his father, Takelot II. On the basis of Osorkon B's well known"" Chronicle"", most Egyptologists today accept that Takelot II's 25th regnal year is equivalent to Shoshenq III's 22nd year.

Invasion of the Cape Colony
The British expedition was led by Vice-Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone and sailed in April 1795, arriving off Simon's Town at the cape in June. Attempts were made to negotiate a settlement with the colony, but talks achieved nothing and an amphibious landing was made on 7 August. A short battle was fought at Muizenberg, and skirmishing between British and Dutch forces continued until September when a larger military force landed. With Cape Town under threat, Dutch governor, Abraham Josias Sluysken, surrendered the colony. Elphinstone subsequently strengthened the garrison against counterattack and stationed a Royal Navy squadron off the port. Almost a year later a Dutch reinforcement convoy reached the colony only to find that it was badly outnumbered, and surrendered without a fight. The British occupation continued until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 when it was returned to the Dutch. In 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars, a second British invasion reoccupied the colony after the Battle of Blaauwberg and it remained a British colony until the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910.

Bed and Sofa
Bed and Sofa  is the English name of a 1927 Soviet silent film originally released in the Soviet Union as ""Tretya meshchanskaya"", and is sometimes referred to as ""The Third Meschanskaya"". In addition to the title, ""Bed and Sofa"" it was also released outside of the Soviet Union under the alternate titles of ""Three in a CellarOld Dovecots"", and ""Cellars of Moscow"". The film gets its Russian title from the street on which the main characters live, Third Meshchanskaia Street. Directed by Abram Room and written by Room and Viktor Shklovsky, the film starred Nikolai Batalov as the husband, Kolia, Lyudmila Semyonova as the wife, Liuda, and Vladimir Fogel as the friend, Volodia. Billed as a satire and comedy, ""Bed and Sofa"" nonetheless portrayed the realities of the Moscow working poor, while also dealing with starkly sexual situations, such as polygamy and abortion. It was originally banned in both the United States and Europe due to those stark sexual situations. The screenplay was supposedly based on the true love story of the acclaimed Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky who lived with his ""muse"" Lilya Brik and her husband Osip Brik for some years. The characters themselves also resembled the trio, with Vladimir Fogel as Mayakovsky, Lyudmila Semyonova as Lilya and Nikolai Batalov as Osip Brik. The parallels were so obvious that some critics and associates accused Viktor Shklovsky of indelicacy and gossiping. Shklovsky himself never openly admitted it, yet in his diaries he mentions that during the work on the screenplay they ¬´were living next to Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik¬ª, which is an obvious hint. While movies made in the USSR would soon be regulated to the ideals of Soviet realism, some films at this time were able to present starker themes. Even so, ""Bed and Sofa"" was controversial at the time of release in the Soviet Union, due to its focus on human relationships, while the state and the party are almost completely disregarded. In fact, at one point Kolya even declines to go to a Party meeting. In addition, the film's resolution is ambiguous and comes about without any input from the collective. However, it is now considered a landmark film because of humor, naturalism, and its sympathetic portrayal of the woman.

Mercia
When √Üthelfl√¶d died in 918, √Ülfwynn, her daughter by √Üthelred, succeeded as 'Second Lady of the Mercians', but within six months Edward had deprived her of all authority in Mercia and taken her into Wessex.

Osthryth
Osthryth (died 697), queen of the Mercians, was the wife of King √Üthelred and daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his second wife Eanfl√¶d. She probably married √Üthelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhfl√¶d had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhfl√¶d's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means ""stronghold of Fl√¶de"", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s √Üthelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by √Üthelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that √Üthelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. √Üthelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. √Üthelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against √Üthelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother √Ülfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was ""a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King √Üthelred had married his sister."" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of √Üthelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.

√Üthelred of Mercia
√Üthelred (died after 704) was King of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, √Üthelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain. He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. √Üthelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; √Üthelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria. √Üthelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 √Üthelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. √Üthelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was √Üthelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that √Üthelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.

""Enamorada de Ti""  is a song recorded by American Tejano recording artist Selena and originally written for her second studio album, ""Ven Conmigo"" (1990). The song was written by Selena y Los Dinos band member Pete Astudillo and her brother, A.B. Quintanilla III, and produced by Quintanilla, and is a Spanish-language adaptation of "" Is It the Beat?"", an English song originally written by Quintanilla and Pamela Phillips Oland. ""Enamorada de Ti"" is a freestyle song, a musical genre popular during the late 1980s. The recording was remixed by Juan Magan for the eponymous album in 2012, a project headed by Humberto Gatica. Although the song was moderately successful during the early 1990s, it was exposed to a wider audience in the remix album ""Enamorada de Ti"". Because of this, the song peaked at number 17 on the US ""Billboard"" Regional Mexican Digital Songs chart that year. In 1997, the posthumously-released remix version of ""Is It the Beat?"" adopted the rap verse found in ""Enamorada de Ti"". In the lyrics the protagonist sings to her love interest about his departure, which has saddened her; without him she cannot function normally, because she is in love with him. Selena performed the song during her Ven Conmigo Tour (1990‚Äì92) and at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards, where she received the Female Vocalist of the Year award.

Jacobo √Årbenz
Juan Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n (September 14, 1913 ‚Äì January 27, 1971) was a Guatemalan military officer and politician who served as the 25th president of Guatemala. He was Minister of National Defense from 1944 to 1951, and the second democratically elected President of Guatemala from 1951 to 1954. He was a major figure in the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution, which represented some of the few years of representative democracy in Guatemalan history. The landmark program of agrarian reform √Årbenz enacted as president was very influential across Latin America. √Årbenz was born in 1913 to a wealthy family, son of a Swiss German father and a Guatemalan mother. He graduated with high honors from a military academy in 1935, and served in the army until 1944, quickly rising through the ranks. During this period, he witnessed the violent repression of agrarian laborers by the United States-backed dictator Jorge Ubico, and was personally required to escort chain-gangs of prisoners, an experience that contributed to his progressive views. In 1938 he met and married Mar√≠a Vilanova, who was a great ideological influence on him, as was Jos√© Manuel Fortuny, a Guatemalan communist. In October 1944 several civilian groups and progressive military factions led by √Årbenz and Francisco Arana rebelled against Ubico's repressive policies. In the elections that followed, Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo was elected president, and began a highly popular program of social reform. √Årbenz was appointed Minister of Defense, and played a crucial role in putting down a military coup in 1949. After the death of Arana, √Årbenz contested the presidential elections that were held in 1950 and without significant opposition defeated Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes, his nearest challenger, by a margin of over 50%. He took office on March 15, 1951, and continued the social reform policies of his predecessor. These reforms included an expanded right to vote, the ability of workers to organize, legitimizing political parties, and allowing public debate. The centerpiece of his policy was an agrarian reform law under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. His policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was also concerned by the presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, and √Årbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'√©tat engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. √Årbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an apology for √Årbenz's overthrow.

The South Tropical Region includes the South Equatorial Belt (SEB) and the South Tropical Zone. It is by far the most active region the planet, as it is home to its strongest retrograde jet stream. The SEB is usually the broadest, darkest belt on Jupiter; it is sometimes split by a zone (the SEBZ), and can fade entirely every 3 to 15 years before reappearing in what is known as an SEB Revival cycle. A period of weeks or months following the belt's disappearance, a white spot forms and erupts dark brownish material which is stretched into a new belt by Jupiter's winds. The belt most recently disappeared in May 2010. Another characteristic of the SEB is a long train of cyclonic disturbances following the Great Red Spot. Like the NTropZ, the STropZ is one of the most prominent zones on the planet; not only does it contain the GRS, but it is occasionally rent by a South Tropical Disturbance (STropD), a division of the zone that can be very long - lived; the most famous one lasted from 1901 to 1939.

Trail of Tears
In 1831, the Choctaw became the first Nation to be removed, and their removal served as the model for all future relocations. After two wars, many Seminoles were removed in 1832.

Satumaa
""Satumaa"" (roughly, in English ""The Fabled Land"" or ""The Fairytale Land"") is the quintessential Finnish tango. It was written by Unto Mononen, and published in 1955. The most famous recording is probably the one made by Reijo Taipale in 1962. The lyrics tell a story of a distant land beyond the sea ‚Äî a happy paradise ‚Äî however, the narrator can only reach it in his thoughts. The song has been recorded countless times, mainly by male Finnish tango singers. An unusual take on ""Satumaa"" (and perhaps one more likely to be known outside of Finland) appears on a Frank Zappa live album from a Helsinki concert in 1974. Requested at short notice, the band plays the song from sheet music with the (non-Finnish-speaking) vocalist Napoleon Murphy Brock trying his best to read the Finnish lyrics. Dweezil Zappa and his ensemble Zappa plays Zappa played a part of the song on their 6 June 2009 and 29 November 2013 concerts at the same venue. The name ""Satumaa"" is also mentioned in a pop rock song ""Satumaa-tango"" by Finnish Maija Vilkkumaa. M.A. Numminen, in his novel ""Tango is my passion"", says: ""I have heard it was proposed for inclusion in a new hymn book. I think it would be wonderful if it was hymn number 666. During the service I could dance to it with organ accompaniment. Perhaps I would get nearer to God.""

Jacques-Antoine-Marie Lemoine
Jacques-Antoine-Marie Lemoine, also Lemoyne (17 July 1751 ‚Äì 7 February 1824), was a French artist, known primarily for portraiture. Lemoine was born in Rouen. He declined to follow his father's precedent in becoming a notary, and instead began study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Rouen. Having moved to Paris by 1772, he studied under Jean-Jacques Lagren√©e (1737‚Äì1821) and Maurice-Quentin de la Tour (1704‚Äì1788). He was attracted to Parisian theater and music, and early in his career often portrayed actors, singers, and musicians, using pastels and chalk. He also worked in oil, watercolor, and porcelain. In the late 1770s or early 1780s, he may have sketched for fashion plates. In 1783, Lemoine married the artist Agathe-Fran√ßoise Bonvallet. He began his work as a miniaturist in the mid-1780s. His early miniatures are influenced by the ""free and painterly technique"" of Pierre-Adolphe Hall. In 1785, he painted Louise Beno√Æt Zamor, the page of Madame du Barry and later revolutionary. The portrait is one piece of evidence for Zamor's African origin. Lemoine invented a perspective easel for use in landscape painting, and another device to help create likenesses in portraiture. He also collected texts on geometry and perspective in relation to design and painting. Lemoine's wife died in 1794, and he returned to Rouen, where he was appointed professor of drawing at the √âcole de Marine in 1799. After 1798, he produced few works, but kept a pied-√†-terre in Paris and continued to exhibit at the Salons through 1817. He died at his home in Paris, and bequeathed his manuscript collection to the state. Germaine Greer points out that because Marie-Victoire Lemoine sometimes signed her works ""Lemoine,"" the works of the two artists may sometimes be misattributed.

Meritaten
Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty. Her name means ""She who is beloved of Aten""; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped. She held several titles, performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare, who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten. Meritaten also may have served as pharaoh in her own right under the name, Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten.

Meritaten Tasherit
Meritaten Tasherit, which means"" Meritaten the Younger"" was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Meritites II
Meritites II (Merytiotes, Meritetes) or Meritites A (""beloved of her father"") was a 4th dynasty Princess of Ancient Egypt, and probably a daughter of King Khufu.

She married the Director of the Palace Akhethotep (a non-royal court official) and she had several children with her husband. Meritites and her husband shared a mastaba (G 7650) in Giza.

Gottschalk (Obotrite prince)
Saint Gottschalk (or Godescalc)  (died 6 June 1066) was a prince of the Obotrite confederacy from 1043 to 1066. He established a Slavic kingdom on the Elbe (in the area of present-day northeastern Germany) in the mid-11th century. His object in life seems to have been to collect the scattered tribes of the Slavs into one kingdom, and to make that kingdom Christian. ""A pious and god-fearing man"" , Gottschalk effected the Christianisation of the Slavic tribes of the Elbe. He organised missions of German priests and founded monasteries at Oldenburg, Mecklenburg, Ratzeburg, L√ºbeck, and Lenzen, erecting the first three into dioceses. He himself often accompanied the missionaries on their work and augmented their message with his own explanations and instructions. In all this, he was supported by the efforts of Adalbert, Archbishop of Hamburg. However, the Obotrite nobility and peasantry largely remained pagan.
