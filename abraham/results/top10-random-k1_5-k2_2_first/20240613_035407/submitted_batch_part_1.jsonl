Her actual name was Jiang Caipin (\"\u6c5f\u91c7\u860b\"), originally called Consort Jiang. After being told by her that she greatly favored Plum-Blossom flowers (the flower is pronounced as \"mei\" in Chinese), Emperor Xuanzong began to fondly address her as Consort Mei. Consort Mei was initially selected by Gao Lishi, a eunuch official of Emperor Xuanzong, to become one of Emperor Xuanzong's concubines in his harem. As Consort Mei was the most literate and talented concubines, she soon obtained Xuanzong's favors. To express the favors towards Consort Mei, Xuanzong commanded servants to plant Plum-Blossom trees all around her palace to please her interest. Xuanzong even lovingly complimented her beauty as more adorable than Zhao Feiyan, and swore that he would never change his heart for her. However, in 737, after the death of Consort Wu, another favorite concubine of Xuanzong, Xuanzong was deeply depressed until Gao Lishi convinced him to try looking at Yang Yuhuan - the wife of prince Li Mao, Xuanzong son with Consort Wu since her beauty was described as the most \"irresistible\". Being curious, Xuanzong ordered Yang Yuhuan to come and subsequently fell in love with her beauty. Since Yuhuan was still literally his daughter-in-law (as she was Li Mao's wife), emperor Xuanzong then stealthily arranged Yuhuan to become a Taoist nun, after a brief moment, Xuanzong eventually offered Yuhuan honorable title as Yang Guifei (with \"Guifei\" being the highest rank for imperial consorts) after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife. Yuhuan became Xuanzong's most beloved consort as Xuanzong soon forgot about Consort Wu's death. His favors towards Consort Mei also waned. In 755, An Lushan began to create a rebellion (known as An Lushan Rebellion) in the palace. Emperor Xuanzong decided to bring Yang Guifei and his cortege along to flee from the capital Chang'an to Chengdu. Consort Mei was left behind then murdered during the rebellion.\n\nM. S.

She lived at the time of the Seleucid king of Syria Antiochus X Eusebes who reigned 95 BC- 92 or 88 BC.\n\nLaodice (wife of Mithridates III of Pontus)\nLaodice (fl. late 3rd \u2013 early 2nd centuries BCE) was a Greek Princess from the Seleucid Empire and the wife of King Mithridates III of Pontus. Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice and Laodice VI. Laodice bore Mithridates III three children: Mithridates IV of Pontus, Pharnaces I of Pontus and Laodice.\n\nAntiochus IX Cyzicenus\nAntiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus (\"Antiochus the Pious, the Cyzicene\") was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom. He was the son of Antiochus VII Sidetes and Cleopatra Thea. He left the kingdom in 129 BC and went to the city of Cyzicus, but he returned in 116 BC to challenge his half-brother Antiochus VIII for power. The siblings fought a twenty-year civil war. In 112 BC, Antiochus IX's wife, Cleopatra IV, was killed by her sister Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus VIII. Tryphaena herself died shortly afterwards. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; he was succeeded by his sons Seleucus VI and Demetrius III. Antiochus IX then took the capital Antioch and married his deceased wife's sister Cleopatra Selene, who was herself the widow of Antiochus VIII. Seleucus VI continued the war against his uncle. Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus was killed in battle in 96 BC.\n\nAntiochus VII Sidetes\nAntiochus VII Euergetes (c.164/160 BC - 129 BC) , nicknamed Sidetes  (from Side, a city in Asia Minor), also known as Antiochus the Pious, was ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from July/August 138 to 129 BC. He was the last Seleucid king of any stature. After Antiochus was killed in battle, the Seleucid realm was restricted to Syria.\n\nCowboys & Aliens\nCowboys& Aliens is a 2011 American science fiction Western film directed by Jon Favreau and starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde.

The plot revolves around an amnesiac outlaw( Craig), a wealthy cattleman( Ford), and a mysterious traveler( Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople abducted by aliens. The screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, based on a screen story by the latter two along with Steve Oedekerk. The film was produced by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with Steven Spielberg and Favreau serving as executive producers. The project began development in April 1997, when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures bought film rights to a concept pitched by Rosenberg, former president at Malibu Comics, which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of$ 163 million, filming for\" Cowboys& Aliens\" began in June 2010, in New Mexico and California. Despite studio pressure to release the film in 3- D, Favreau chose to film traditionally and in anamorphic format( widescreen picture on standard 35 mm film) to further a\" classic movie feel\". Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's\" inherently comic\" title and premise. The film's aliens were designed to be\" cool and captivating\", with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place. \" Cowboys& Aliens\" premiered at the 2011 San Diego Comic- Con and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on, 2011.

The 4004 was the first commercially available monolithic CPU, fully integrated in one small chip. Such a feat of integration was made possible by the use of the then - new silicon gate technology for integrated circuits, originally developed by Faggin (with Tom Klein) at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968, which allowed twice the number of random - logic transistors and an increase in speed by a factor of five compared to the incumbent MOS aluminum gate technology.

In October 690 he ceded the imperial throne to his mother, who installed herself as empress regnant \u2013 the only woman in Chinese history ever to rule as empress regnant. Emperor Ruizong was reduced to the position of crown prince, with the unconventional title of \"Huangsi\" (\u7687\u55e3, \"imperial successor\"). In the following years, Empress Wu's nephews Wu Chengsi and Wu Sansi tried to have one of them named heir to the throne, but Wu Zetian resisted these calls. Eventually, in October 698, faced with foreign invasion and dissatisfaction at home, Empress Wu accepted the suggestion of the chancellor Di Renjie and recalled the exiled Li Xian to the capital Luoyang.

Eventually, in September 712, Emperor Ruizong, believing that astrological signs called for a change of emperors, abdicated in favor of Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong, now carrying the title of \"Taishang Huang\" (retired emperor), continued to wield actual power. However, in 713, suspecting Princess Taiping of planning a coup, Emperor Xuanzong acted first, killing her associates and forcing her to commit suicide.

In this song, Gwenc'hlan is imprisoned after having his eyes gouged out for refusing to convert to Christianity, sings out that he is n't afraid to die and makes a prophecy wherein he will be avenged. The motive of the blinded prisoner is reminiscent of the historical fate of Boethius.

The poem was rediscovered in 1924. The Breton used by this Gwenc'hlan is already deeply pervaded by French.

He returned to military service during World War II.\n\nStranger Things\nThe idea of Stranger Things started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film Prisoners, detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of ``childlike sensibilities ''they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things`` was the best thing ever''. To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered ``bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War ''such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia. Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series, crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror. The Duffer Brothers have cited as influence for the show (among others): Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Robert Zemeckis, George Lucas and Guillermo del Toro; films such as Alien and Stand by Me; Japanese anime such as Akira and Elfen Lied; and video games such as Silent Hill, The Last of Us, and Dark Souls. The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including Beyond the Black Rainbow and D.A.R.Y.L., discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the show.\n\nWho is the paternal grandfather of Alexandre Berthier, 3Rd Prince Of Wagram?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792 -- 1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century. Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (``British Peace ''), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815 -- 1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the`` workshop of the world''. The British Empire expanded to include most of India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world.

It was recorded at the first \"John Wesley Harding\" session on October 17, 1967. It has been covered by many artists, including Joan Baez on her all-Dylan album \"Any Day Now\", as well as by Vic Chesnutt, Eric Clapton, John Doe, Thea Gilmore, Adam Selzer and Dirty Projectors. In addition, Jimi Hendrix at one point intended to cover this song, but felt it was too personal to Dylan and instead covered a different song from the album, \"All Along the Watchtower\". \"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" is a pensive ballad. Like the rest of the \"John Wesley Harding\" album, the music of \"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" uses spare, unobtrusive musical accompaniment. The primary instruments are an acoustic guitar and drums. The lyrics describe a dream that is enigmatic and subject to interpretation. However, the lyrics do convey a deeply felt sense of guilt, as well as a vision of faith, righteousness, fear and betrayal. The sense of guilt is particularly prevalent in the final verse: The opening couplet of the song paraphrases the song \"Joe Hill\", which begins with the lines \"I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night\", by Alfred Hayes and Earl Robinson. \" Joe Hill\" was a folk song written as a tribute to the union organizer Joe Hill, who was viewed by supporters as a martyr after he was convicted of a motiveless murder based on weak evidence. The reference is ironic, since the song seems to deny the existence of modern martyrs to lead humanity towards salvation. The St. Augustine in the title has often been linked to St. Augustine of Hippo, although St. Augustine of Hippo was not martyred, but died during the Vandal sack of Hippo. He was, however, a philosopher who wrote about evil and guilt, he defined the concept of original sin and therefore mankind's ultimate guilt, and could have viewed himself as being martyred in the sense of being killed by his own sins. In the dream revealed in the song, St. Augustine wears a coat of solid gold, which may signify either the worldly excesses of mankind and the Catholic Church or St. Augustine's own spiritual wealth. He also carries a blanket, which may be a sign of asceticism or of his compassion. St. Augustine searches for \"the very souls / Whom already have been sold,\" a reference to the commercialization of mankind's inner self, a motif that will recur on later songs on the album such as \"Dear Landlord\" and \"The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\". He tells \"ye gifted kings and queens\" that \"No martyr is among ye now,\" but consoles them with the knowledge that nonetheless they are not alone. But the dream ends with the narrator realizing that he himself is among those that put St. Augustine to death, initiating his feelings of guilt as he now sees the error of his ways. One interpretation of the song is that St. Augustine is a stand-in for Dylan himself, who had been viewed as a prophet or messiah, was nearly \"martyred\" in a motorcycle accident a few months before the song was written, but in any case had come too late since mankind (including himself) had already sold its soul to many temptations. Another possible interpretation is that Dylan sees himself as being among those who \"put Him out to death,\" a reference to responsibility for the death of Jesus, the ultimate expression of personal guilt. In a 2005 poll of artists published by \"MojoI Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" was listed as the #76 greatest Bob Dylan song of all time. Dylan played the song live, in a slow waltz arrangement, at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969, a performance included on \"Isle of Wight Live\", part of the 4-CD deluxe edition of . He also played the song live on the Rolling Thunder Revue in the 1970s, as may be heard on the box set , and with the Heartbreakers in the 1980s, but has rarely performed the song live since. In 2016, Eric Clapton released his take on the tune for his studio album \" I Still Do\".\n\nWho is older, Aryeh Ben-Eliezer or Jason Pociask?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

By issue# 58( May \u2013 June 1949) it is referred to as the Fortress of Solitude, seems at a glance to be a freestanding castle, and is said to be located in a\" polar waste\". When the Fortress reappears in 1958 and for the first time takes center stage in a story(\" The Super- Key to Fort SupermanAction Comics\"# 241), it is again an underground complex in a mountainous cliffside. Traditionally, the Fortress of Solitude is located in the Arctic, though more recent versions of the\" Superman\" comics have placed the Fortress in other locations, including the Antarctic, the Andes, and the Amazon rainforest. The general public in Superman's world is either unaware or at best only vaguely aware of the existence of the Fortress, and its location is kept secret from all but Superman's closest friends and allies( such as Lois Lane and Batman). A trademark of the Fortress is that it contains a memorial statue of Jor- El and Lara, Superman's Kryptonian parents, holding a large globe of Krypton. Although Superman has living quarters at the Fortress, his main residence is still Clark Kent's apartment in Metropolis. The arctic Fortress of Solitude concept was first created for pulp hero Doc Savage during the 1930s.\n\nJenny Lund (politician)\nJenny Lund( 15 February 1916 \u2013 17 February 1998) was a Norwegian politician.

A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\n\nAntoine Gay\nAntoine Gay( May 31, 1790 \u2013 June 13, 1871) was a Frenchman who was believed by some to have been possessed by a demon named Isacaron.\n\nArcadi Gaydamak\nArcadi Aleksandrovich Gaydamak (born 8 April 1952 in Moscow, USSR) is a Russian-born French-Israeli businessman, philanthropist, and President of the Congress of Jewish Religious Communities and Organizations of Russia (KEROOR).

In the AngolaGate scandal, he was convicted of failure to declare income. On November 24, 2015, he started serving a prison sentence at Fresnes prison in France for that tax issue. In the early 21st century, Gaydamak returned to Israel, where he founded Social Justice, a movement that became a political party. He ran for mayor of Jerusalem but did not win. He bought Hapoel Jerusalem, a professional basketball club. He also bought two newspapers, one in France and one in Russia.

If one of the tanks is empty, the bivalent BMW engine unit switches over automatically to the other fuel system. One decisive advantage of the combustion engine is bivalence. It enables both hydrogen and petrol to be used, thus creating the ideal conditions for a transition from non-regenerative to regenerative drive energies. During electrolysis water is split into its components of hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is stored and the oxygen is needed in the vehicle for the combustion of the hydrogen. The combustion process generates energy and water as a waste product, which returns to the natural water cycle. And so with the aid of regenerative energy suppliers, a theoretically emission-free fuel is obtained.\n\nWho is Gaston, Duke Of Orl\u00e9ans's paternal grandmother?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Howard was the son and heir of Sir William Howard of Naworth in Cumberland, by Mary, daughter of William, Lord Eure, and great-grandson of Lord William Howard, \"Belted Will\" (1563\u20131640), the third son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. In 1645 he conformed to the Church of England and supported the government of the Commonwealth, being appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1650. He bought Carlisle Castle and became governor of the town. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Worcester on Oliver Cromwell's side and made a member of the council of state in 1653, chosen captain of the protector's body-guard and selected to carry out various public duties. In 1653 he was nominated as Member of Parliament for the Four Northern Counties in the Barebones Parliament. He was elected MP for Cumberland in 1654. In 1655 Howard was given a regiment, was appointed a commissioner to try the northern rebels, and a deputy major-general of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland. He was re-elected MP for Cumberland in 1656. In 1657 he was included in Cromwell's House of Lords and voted for the protector's assumption of the royal title the same year. In 1659 he urged Richard Cromwell to defend his government by force against the army leaders, but his advice being refused he used his influence in favour of a restoration of the monarchy, and after Richard's fall he was imprisoned. In April 1660 he sat again in parliament for Cumberland, and at the Restoration was made custos rotulorum and Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland and Lord Lieutenant of Westmorland. On 20 April 1661 Howard was created Baron Dacre of Gillesland, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Earl of Carlisle; the same year he was made Vice-Admiral of Northumberland, Cumberland and Durham, and in 1662 joint commissioner for the office of Earl Marshal. In 1663 he was appointed ambassador to Russia, Sweden and Denmark, and in 1668 he carried the Garter to Charles XI of Sweden. In 1667 Howard was made lieutenant-general of the forces and joint commander-in-chief of the four northernmost counties. In 1672 he became one of the commissioners for the office of Lord Lieutenant of Durham, and in 1673 deputy earl marshal. He commanded a regiment in the fresh-raised Blackheath Army of 1673, which was intended to see action against the Dutch. Following the Treaty of Westminster the regiment was disbanded. In 1678 he was appointed governor of Jamaica, but his instructions to introduce Poynings' Law to the island were successfully opposed by planters elected to the Jamaican Assembly. Calling the elected members \"fools, asses, beggars and cowards\", the governor arrested their leaders, William Beeston (governor) and Samuel Long, father of Jamaican planter-historian Edward Long. However, when they were deported back to England, Beeston and Long successfully argued their case, and the governor's instructions were cancelled. He was reappointed governor of Carlisle. He died in 1685, and was buried in York Minster. He married Anne (died 1696), daughter of Edward Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Escrick and great-granddaughter of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, by whom he had six children: Colonel Thomas Howard (died 1678), notorious for the 1662 duel where he left Henry Jermyn, 1st Baron Dover for dead (they were rivals for the affections of Anna Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury), was his younger brother. He was pardoned and soon afterwards married as her third husband Mary Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.\n\nTrichomoniasis\nTrichomoniasis (trich) is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. About 70% of women and men do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy.Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) which is most often spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also spread through genital touching. People who are infected may spread the disease even when symptoms are not present. Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in the vaginal fluid using a microscope, culturing the vagina or urine, or testing for the parasite's DNA. If present other STIs should be tested for.Methods of prevention include not having sex, using condoms, not douching, and being tested for STIs before having sex with a new partner. Trichomoniasis can be cured with antibiotics, either metronidazole or tinidazole. Sexual partners should also be treated. About 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatment.There were about 122 million new cases of trichomoniasis in 2015. In the United States, there are about 2 million women affected. It occurs more often in women than men. Trichomonas vaginalis was first identified in 1836 by Alfred Donn\u00e9.
