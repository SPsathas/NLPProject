He founded the Grey Abbey in Kildare, Ireland for the Franciscans in 1260. During the Second Barons' War campaign of 1265, William held Gloucester Castle against Prince Edward. He was pardoned afterwards and entered the service of King Henry III of England. He served against the Welsh in 1277 and later in 1282. He was appointed the justice of the forests north of the Trent in 1285. Upon the death of his brother John de Vesci in 1289, William succeeded to the family estates, including as Lord of Sprouston in Scotland. He was also granted the Constable of Scarborough Castle between 1289 until 1292. William was sent with Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham in 1289 to represent King Edward I of England in Scotland. He also founded White Abbey, near Kildare, Ireland for the Carmelites in 1290. Upon the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, William became one of the competitors for the Crown of Scotland, deriving his claim from his grandmother, Margaret, illegitimate daughter of William the Lion and the wife of Eustace fitz John. William's claim was withdrawn on the eve of the King Edward I of England announcing which of the claimants would inherit the throne in 1292. With the death of his mother, Agnes on 11 May 1290, he inherited large estates in Ireland, including the franchise of the County Kildare with Kildare Castle and Rathangan Castle. On 12 September 1290, William was appointed Lord Justice in Ireland by King Edward I of England. His service was interrupted by complaints with William entering the king's court in 1293 and 1294 to answer charges against him. Sir John FitzThomas, 4th Lord Offaly, fiercely quarrelled with William over rival claimants of the King of Connaught. FitzThomas made claims to King Edward I of England that William had accused the king of cowardice during the siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, and was organising a rebellion against the king. William lost his position as Lord Justice. William attempted to sue FitzThomas for defamation before the council at Dublin. King Edward I summoned all the parties to Westminster, however, FitzThomas did not appear, and although William requested for a judgment in his favour by reason of the default, this was not allowed, with the matter finally being resolved during the parliament in August 1295. He was summoned to Parliament as a baron in 1295. While he regained the king's favour, William did not regain his position of Lord Justice in Ireland, however was restored to his former position as justiciar of the forests beyond Trent. He was sent to Gascony in December 1295 on the king's service. William surrendered his lands of Kildare in 1297 on condition of his and his brother's debts to the exchequer being forgiven. Edward I regranted his lands in Kildare for life only. William also resigned Malton Castle and his Yorkshire estates to Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, however he received them back for life and entailed after his death on his illegitimate son and his heirs.

Her mother's name is not recorded. She had at least one brother and at least one sister, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d (died circa 1002). \u00c6lffl\u00e6d was married to Byrhtnoth, who probably succeeded her father as ealdorman of Essex.

Schure founded the New York Institute of Technology( NYIT) in 1955. He also served as the Chancellor of Nova Southeastern University( NSU) from 1970 until 1985. Schure is credited with saving Nova University, which was in deep financial trouble, after he became the school's chancellor in 1970. The university is now called Nova Southeastern University, and is now the largest private university in Florida, with more than 28,000 students as of 2009. Schure and then- Nova University President Abraham Fischler, Ed.D., formed a federation between Nova and the New York Institute of Technology. The partnership between the two institutions brought money and new programs to Nova University. The money from NYIT allowed Nova University to remain open during its financial difficulties. The alliance between NYIT and Nova University ended in 1985. In November 1974 Schure hired recent University of Utah doctoral graduate Edwin Catmull to direct NYIT's fledgling computer graphics lab, and ensured that the lab received special funding for more than 5 years. Schure was an early champion of computer animation; in 1979 Catmull left to form a computer- graphics group with Lucasfilm and the core technical team- including computer animation pioneers Alvy Ray Smith, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim, Jim Blinn, and Jim Clark- came from the NYIT lab. ( In 1986, that computer- graphics group would be funded by recently fired Steve Jobs as the independent company Pixar which manufactured and sold image- processing computers using the concepts first developed at NYIT, and also produced projects using them.) Although Clark would move on to found Silicon Graphics and Netscape, the rest of the NYIT team continued to play key roles as Pixar's animation developed from its first short films in the mid-1980s onward. It can be said that Dr. Schure's vision and support from 1975 to 1980, and the low- pressure academic research lab environment at NYIT, was an essential contributor to the development of many of the technical innovations needed to produce realistic computer generated films. He funded the computers and frame buffers used in the making of the unfinished computer- generated film\" The Works( film)\". It was also during this time that Schure directed the animated movie Tubby the Tuba( 1975 film). Alexander Schure died from complications of Alzheimer's Disease on Long Island on October 29, 2009, at the age of 89. He was survived by his second wife, Gail; and four children- Dr. Barbara Schure Weinschel, Dr. Matthew Schure, Dr. Jonathan Schure, and Mr. Louis Schure. Following his death, former NSU president Fischler said Schure\" was a brilliant individual with a very creative mind. He was an excellent friend to me and the university. There would be no NSU without him.\" He received doctoral degrees in engineering and education from New York University.\n\nThe Little Gray Lady\nThe Little Gray Lady is a lost 1914 silent film drama directed by Francis Powers and starring Jane Grey of the Broadway stage.

Also, Claudio Coassin, who played keyboards, switched to vocals, leaving keyboards to Andrea Corona.

With this new direction, the band recorded their debut album\" Tales from Sadness\" in 2005 with Arise Records. The second\" official\" chapter of the band,\" Flies& Lies\"( Lifeforce), released in 2007 and produced by Tommy Handsen, gave Raintime the possibility to perform live at ProgPower USA with bands like After Forever, Virgin Steele and Sonata Arctica.
