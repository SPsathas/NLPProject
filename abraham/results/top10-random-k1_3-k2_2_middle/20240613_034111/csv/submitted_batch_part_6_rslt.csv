Eochaid Ailtlethan
Eochaid (or Eochu) Ailtlethan (""broad blade""), son of Ailill Caisfiaclach, was, according to medieval Irish legends and historical traditions, a High King of Ireland. According to the ""Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn"", he took the throne after overthrowing and killing the previous incumbent, Adamair, and ruled for eleven years, until he was killed in battle by Fergus Fortamail. The ""Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn"" synchronises his reign with that of Ptolemy V Epiphanes in Egypt (204‚Äì181 BC). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's ""Foras Feasa ar √âirinn"" dates his reign to 285‚Äì274 BC, that of the ""Annals of the Four Masters"" (which gives him a reign of seventeen years) to 414‚Äì396 BC.

Eochaid mac √Åeda Find
Eochaid mac √Åeda Find is a spurious King of D√°l Riata found in some rare High Medieval king-lists and in older history books.

The reigns of Selbach mac Ferchair, D√∫ngal mac Selbaig and, perhaps, Alp√≠n mac Echdach, are similarly misplaced in the sources which contain this Eochaid.

Heinrich Brunner
Heinrich Brunner (21 June 1840 ‚Äì 11 August 1915) was a German historian born at Wels in Upper Austria. After studying at the universities of Vienna, G√∂ttingen and Berlin, he became professor at the University of Lemberg in 1866, and in quick succession held similar positions at Prague, Strasbourg and Berlin. From 1872 Brunner devoted himself especially to studying the early laws and institutions of the Franks and kindred peoples of Western Europe, and on these subjects his researches have been of supreme value. He also became a leading authority on modern German law. He became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1884, and in 1887, after the death of Georg Waitz, undertook the supervision of the ""Leges"" section of the ""Monumenta Germaniae Historica"", which he led until his death in 1915. This was the first time that a legal scholar led a section of the MGH; Brunner oversaw an extensive overhaul of the section's program (the re-editing of the ""Capitularia"" and the ""Lex Alamannorum"", then the ""Lex Burgundionum"", and finally the ""Lex Baiuvariorum"").

Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef
Both Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef were sons of a king called Sobekemsaf, most probably Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf (Sobekemsaf II today, not I) based on an inscription from a doorjamb from a 17th Dynasty temple at Gebel Antef. While his own tomb has not been located, it was likely located in the area of Dra' Abu el-Naga' where the pyramid tomb of his brother Nubkheperre Intef was found in 2001. The pyramidion of the pyramid of Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef's pyramid was found in Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It has a slope of 60 degrees and is inscribed with this king's names. The pyramidion is now in the British Museum (BM EA 478).

Kekheretnebti
Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30‚Äì35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.

The son of Sultan al-Adil I, al-Ashraf was installed by his father in Harran in 1201 as Governor of the Jezireh. After his brother al-Mu'azzam's death in 1227, al-Ashraf received a request from his nephew, al-Muazzam's son, An-Nasir Dawud, for aid in opposing al-Kamil of Egypt. Instead, al-Ashraf and al-Kamil came to an agreement to divide their nephew's lands between them. Al-Ashraf captured Damascus in June 1229 and took control of the city. He took Baalbek as well in 1230. In return, he ceded his lands in Mesopotamia to al-Kamil and acknowledged his supremacy, while an-Nasir had to be satisfied with the possession of a principality centered on Kerak in the Transjordan region. A number of years later, al-Ashraf began to chafe under his brother's authority, and in 1237 allied himself with Kayqubad I, the Seljuk Sultan of R√ªm, and various Ayyubid princelings based in Syria, against al-Kamil. However, Kayqubad died early in the summer of that year, and al-Ashraf himself died on 27 August, breaking up the alliance. Al-Ashraf was succeeded in Damascus by his younger brother, as-Salih Ismail.

Colonels Mountain (New Brunswick)
Colonels Mountain is a mountain in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. It lies adjacent to Big Bald Mountain, at the headwaters of the Northwest Miramichi River and the Sevogle River. The mountain top has been weathered to generate a series of mushroom- shaped granitic tors. Because the weathering process which forms tors is normally very slow, these features have been interpreted as indicating that part of northern New Brunswick escaped the last, Wisconsinan glaciation. It has been suggested, however, that the mountain lay near the centre of the ice cap; these erosional remnants thus escaped the scouring action of the glaciers.

He founded the Grey Abbey in Kildare, Ireland for the Franciscans in 1260. During the Second Barons' War campaign of 1265, William held Gloucester Castle against Prince Edward. He was pardoned afterwards and entered the service of King Henry III of England. He served against the Welsh in 1277 and later in 1282. He was appointed the justice of the forests north of the Trent in 1285. Upon the death of his brother John de Vesci in 1289, William succeeded to the family estates, including as Lord of Sprouston in Scotland. He was also granted the Constable of Scarborough Castle between 1289 until 1292. William was sent with Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham in 1289 to represent King Edward I of England in Scotland. He also founded White Abbey, near Kildare, Ireland for the Carmelites in 1290. Upon the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, William became one of the competitors for the Crown of Scotland, deriving his claim from his grandmother, Margaret, illegitimate daughter of William the Lion and the wife of Eustace fitz John.

FitzThomas made claims to King Edward I of England that William had accused the king of cowardice during the siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, and was organising a rebellion against the king. William lost his position as Lord Justice. William attempted to sue FitzThomas for defamation before the council at Dublin. King Edward I summoned all the parties to Westminster, however, FitzThomas did not appear, and although William requested for a judgment in his favour by reason of the default, this was not allowed, with the matter finally being resolved during the parliament in August 1295. He was summoned to Parliament as a baron in 1295. While he regained the king's favour, William did not regain his position of Lord Justice in Ireland, however was restored to his former position as justiciar of the forests beyond Trent. He was sent to Gascony in December 1295 on the king's service. William surrendered his lands of Kildare in 1297 on condition of his and his brother's debts to the exchequer being forgiven. Edward I regranted his lands in Kildare for life only. William also resigned Malton Castle and his Yorkshire estates to Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, however he received them back for life and entailed after his death on his illegitimate son and his heirs. He also placed in charge of Alnwick Castle to Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham on trust, to restore it to his illegitimate son when he became of age. Soon afterwards William died in 1297.

He was the son of the high king Fogartach mac N√©ill (died 724). He is not listed in the poem on the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine rulers in the ""Book of Leinster"", however at his death obit in the annals for 771 he is called King of Brega. His accession to the rule of the U√≠ Chernaig sept in south Brega cannot be dated with certainty. His brother Fergus mac Fogartaig (died 751) is called King of South Brega at his death obit. The annals then record the deaths of his cousin Domnall mac √Åeda in 759 and his brother Finsnechta mac Fogartaig in 761 with no titles. As for his accession to all of Brega, the death of the Brega king D√∫ngal mac Amalgado of the rival northern U√≠ Chonaing sept of Cnogba (Knowth) occurred in 759. Coirpre is first mentioned in the annals with regard to the death of his son Cellach, who was killed by robbers in 767. Then Coirpre is driven into exile in 769 by Donnchad Midi (died 797) of the rival southern Ui Neill branch of Clann Cholm√°in based in Mide. A battle had been fought between the men of Mide and Brega in 766. The year after Coirpre's exile the men of southern Brega were defeated at the Battle of Bolgg B√≥inne in 770 and two members of the sept were slain, Cernach mac Flainn (a grandson of Fogartach) and Flaithbertach mac Flainn as well as the vassal king Uarchride mac Baeth of the Deisi Brega. This was in conjunction with a campaign of Donnchad Midi versus Leinster and may have been part of that or Donnchad may have defeated the men of southern Brega on is way home. Coirpre then reappears in the year 771 at his death obit with the title King of Brega.

Beorhtweald Ealdorman of Kent was an English ruler of the 9th century AD. His father was Burgred of Mercia, his mother: √Üthelswith, and his brother: Beorhtno√∞ √¶thling of Kent.

√Üthelfl√¶d of Damerham
√Üthelfl√¶d, known as √Üthelfl√¶d of Damerham to distinguish her from other women of the same name, was the second wife of King Edmund I of England. √Üthelfl√¶d was a daughter of ealdorman √Ülfgar, probably the ealdorman of Essex. Her mother's name is not recorded. She had at least one brother and at least one sister, √Ülffl√¶d (died circa 1002). √Ülffl√¶d was married to Byrhtnoth, who probably succeeded her father as ealdorman of Essex. Byrhtnoth was killed at the Battle of Maldon in 991. √Üthelfl√¶d and √Ülffl√¶d were √Ülfgar's heirs at his death, some time between 946 and 951 based on the dating of his will, S1483. √Üthelfl√¶d married Edmund in 944 following the death of his first wife √Ülfgifu, mother of the future kings Eadwig and Edgar. She and Edmund are not known to have had any children, and Edmund was killed in 946, leaving √Üthelfl√¶d as a wealthy widow. Records of Ely Cathedral, to which she, her sister, and her brother-in-law, were generous benefactors, say that she then married an ealdorman named √Üthelstan. There were several ealdormen of that name active in the reign of Edmund's brother and successor Eadred, and it most likely that √Üthelfl√¶d married the man known as √Üthelstan Rota, although she could have married √Üthelstan Half-King. √Üthelfl√¶d's will survives, S1494, and her will, and thus her death, is dated to between 962, and more probably 975, and 991. In addition to gifts to Ely, the will endowed Glastonbury, Canterbury, Bury, and the family monastery of Stoke-by-Nayland.

Alexander Schure
Alexander Schure( August 3, 1920- October 29, 2009) was an American academic and entrepreneur. Schure founded the New York Institute of Technology( NYIT) in 1955. He also served as the Chancellor of Nova Southeastern University( NSU) from 1970 until 1985. Schure is credited with saving Nova University, which was in deep financial trouble, after he became the school's chancellor in 1970. The university is now called Nova Southeastern University, and is now the largest private university in Florida, with more than 28,000 students as of 2009. Schure and then- Nova University President Abraham Fischler, Ed.D., formed a federation between Nova and the New York Institute of Technology. The partnership between the two institutions brought money and new programs to Nova University. The money from NYIT allowed Nova University to remain open during its financial difficulties. The alliance between NYIT and Nova University ended in 1985. In November 1974 Schure hired recent University of Utah doctoral graduate Edwin Catmull to direct NYIT's fledgling computer graphics lab, and ensured that the lab received special funding for more than 5 years. Schure was an early champion of computer animation; in 1979 Catmull left to form a computer- graphics group with Lucasfilm and the core technical team- including computer animation pioneers Alvy Ray Smith, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim, Jim Blinn, and Jim Clark- came from the NYIT lab. ( In 1986, that computer- graphics group would be funded by recently fired Steve Jobs as the independent company Pixar which manufactured and sold image- processing computers using the concepts first developed at NYIT, and also produced projects using them.) Although Clark would move on to found Silicon Graphics and Netscape, the rest of the NYIT team continued to play key roles as Pixar's animation developed from its first short films in the mid-1980s onward. It can be said that Dr. Schure's vision and support from 1975 to 1980, and the low- pressure academic research lab environment at NYIT, was an essential contributor to the development of many of the technical innovations needed to produce realistic computer generated films. He funded the computers and frame buffers used in the making of the unfinished computer- generated film"" The Works( film)"". It was also during this time that Schure directed the animated movie Tubby the Tuba( 1975 film). Alexander Schure died from complications of Alzheimer's Disease on Long Island on October 29, 2009, at the age of 89. He was survived by his second wife, Gail; and four children- Dr. Barbara Schure Weinschel, Dr. Matthew Schure, Dr. Jonathan Schure, and Mr. Louis Schure. Following his death, former NSU president Fischler said Schure"" was a brilliant individual with a very creative mind. He was an excellent friend to me and the university. There would be no NSU without him."" He received doctoral degrees in engineering and education from New York University.

Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree, which turned out to be Barry Windham, whom Flair defeated, afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager.

Raintime
Raintime is an Italian progressive/ power metal band, founded in 1999. The band was initially significantly inspired by Dream Theater, and as such composed songs which leaned towards the progressive metal genre. They then recorded an instrumental demo entitled"" Jump in the Past"". After the demo was released, the band's original drummer quit and Enrico Fabris replaced him. Also, Claudio Coassin, who played keyboards, switched to vocals, leaving keyboards to Andrea Corona. Their sound evolved into a new hybrid and borrows elements both from extreme metal, such as death growls and lower tuning of their instruments, and from more melodic genres, especially in regard to keyboards and vocals. With this new direction, the band recorded their debut album"" Tales from Sadness"" in 2005 with Arise Records. The second"" official"" chapter of the band,"" Flies& Lies""( Lifeforce), released in 2007 and produced by Tommy Handsen, gave Raintime the possibility to perform live at ProgPower USA with bands like After Forever, Virgin Steele and Sonata Arctica. Their latest album, entitled"" Psychromatic"", was released on 16 March 2010. Raintime stated on their Facebook on 27 May 2012 that the band would be disbanding due to"" too many new members"".

Steve Bartman incident
During a Major League Baseball (MLB) postseason game played between the Chicago Cubs and the Florida Marlins on October 14, 2003, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois, spectator Steve Bartman disrupted the game by intercepting a potential catch. The incident occurred in the eighth inning of Game 6 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), with Chicago ahead 3 -- 0 and holding a three games to two lead in the best of seven series. Mois√©s Alou attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo. Bartman reached for the ball, deflected it, and disrupted the potential catch. If Alou had caught the ball, it would have been the second out in the inning and the Cubs would have been just four outs away from winning their first National League pennant since 1945. Instead, the Cubs ended up surrendering eight runs in the inning and losing the game, 8 -- 3. When they were eliminated in the seventh game the next day, the incident was seen as the ``first domino ''in the turning point of the series.

Goli Soda
Baradwaj Rangan wrote ""The signature achievement of ""Goli Soda"" is its ruthless unmasking of how hollow most of our masala movies are, and how, with a little imagination, just a little, you can make a film which does not insult the audience"" and went on to state, ""I will be very surprised if there's a more entertaining, more inventive, more well-acted masala movie this year"". The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity"". Cinemalead.com rated it with 4/5 stars and said ""Overall if you prefer to watch a gutsy film which is different and unique from the routine Tamil cinema, go and watch Goli Soda which surely deserves a repeated viewing"".

King Arthur
The historical basis for the King Arthur legend has long been debated by scholars. One school of thought, citing entries in the Historia Brittonum (History of the Britons) and Annales Cambriae (Welsh Annals), sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure, a Romano - British leader who fought against the invading Anglo - Saxons some time in the late 5th to early 6th century. The Historia Brittonum, a 9th - century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius, contains the first datable mention of King Arthur, listing twelve battles that Arthur fought. These culminate in the Battle of Badon, where he is said to have single - handedly killed 960 men. Recent studies, however, question the reliability of the Historia Brittonum.

Code of the Nesilim
The Code of Nesilim( Imperial Hittites) is an ancient Hittite( Nesili) legal code dating from c. 1650 ‚Äì 1500 BCE. This contained the laws that reflected the Hittite empire's social structure, sense of justice, and morality, addressing common outlawed actions such as assault, theft, murder, witchcraft, and divorce, among others. It is particularly notable due to a number of its provisions, covering social issues that included the humane treatment of slaves. Although they were considered lesser than free men, the slaves under the code were allowed to choose whomever they wanted to marry, buy property, open businesses, and purchase their freedom. In comparison with The Code of Assura or the Code of Hammurabi, the Code of Nesilim also provided less- severe punishments for the code's violations. While it is not known who exactly authored the legal document, some historians believe that its source was someone important or of high power in the Hittite society and this could even be a king. The ancient legal document was posted online by Paul Halsall, a professor at Fordham University as part of his Internet History Sourcebooks Project.
