In addition to improving soil fertility, annelids serve humans as food and as bait. Scientists observe annelids to monitor the quality of marine and fresh water.

E. Moore's radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article The Refutation of Idealism is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism esse est percipi, \"to be is to be perceived\", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are necessarily connected so that \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" are identical - \"to be yellow\" is \"to be experienced as yellow\". But it also seems there is a difference between \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" and \"that esse is held to be percipi, solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it\". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley. This argument did not show that the GEM (in post\u2013Stove vernacular, see below) is logically invalid.\n\nWhere did Carlos Bee's father die?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

These issues owe their virulence to a geographical peculiarity of the Aegean sea and its territories. While the mainland coasts of Greece and Turkey bordering the Aegean Sea on both sides represent roughly equal shares of its total coastline, the overwhelming number of the many Aegean islands belong to Greece. In particular, there is a chain of Greek islands lined up along the Turkish west coast (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and the Dodecanese islands), partly in very close proximity to the mainland. Their existence blocks Turkey from extending any of its zones of influence beyond a few nautical miles off its coastline. As the breadth of maritime and areal zones of influence, such as the territorial waters and national airspace, are measured from the nearest territory of the state in question, including its islands, any possible extension of such zones would necessarily benefit Greece much more than Turkey proportionally.\n\nWhich film whose director is younger, Kiladigalu or He'S My Girl?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

His film \"Bully\" premiered at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival. \"Bully\" follows several families from across ethnic, cultural and geographic boundaries as they grapple with the tragedy their family has faced as a result of bullying. Several of the families profiled in the film had lost a child because he or she became fed up with the mostly mental and sometimes physical abuse they experienced on a daily, even hourly basis at school, on the school bus, and in their communities. In a screening of \"Bully\" in Minneapolis in September 2011, director Hirsch told the audience during the post-film Q & A that he himself had been bullied, and that was part of the inspiration for the film, and for the direction he took it. In an interview with Twin Cities Jewish news website \"TC Jewfolk\" after the screening Hirsch continued: \"I felt that the hardest part of being bullied was communicating,\" Hirsch said. \"And getting help. I couldn\u2019t enroll people's support. People would say things like 'get over it,' even my own father and mother. They weren\u2019t with me. That was a big part of my wanting to make the film. It\u2019s cathartic on a daily basis. \" Hirsch said he hoped the film grows far beyond him, inspiring advocacy, engagement, and empowerment not just in people who are being bullied and in their families, but by those of us who all too often stand by and do nothing. He stated, \"I hope we build something that\u2019s really sustainable. I hope this takes on a life of its own.\" Hirsch is Jewish. In a Google+ Hangout on March 19, 2012, Lee Hirsch was interviewed by newscaster Tony McEwing at \" My Fox 11 LA\" studios, where Hirsch said: \"I want this to be a grassroots movement so that the local cities can get behind this movie and support it.

Throughout the centuries, there have been many springs of water that have been believed by members of the Orthodox Church to be miraculous. Some still flow to this day, such as the one at Pochaev Lavra in Ukraine, and the Life- Giving Spring of the Theotokos in Constantinople( commemorated annually with the blessing of holy water on Bright Friday). Although Eastern Orthodox do not normally bless themselves with holy water upon entering a church like Catholics do, a quantity of holy water is typically kept in a font placed in the narthex( entrance) of the church, where it is available for anyone who would like to take some of it home with them. It is customary for Orthodox to drink holy water, to use it in their cooking and to sprinkle their houses with it. Often, when objects are blessed in the church( such as the palms on Palm Sunday, Icons or sacred vessels) the blessing is completed by a triple sprinkling with holy water using the words,\" This(\" name of item\") is blessed by the sprinkling of this holy water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\" Holy water is sometimes sprinkled on items or people when they are blessed outside the church building, as part of the prayers of blessing. In Russia, it is common for Orthodox Christians to bring newly bought cars to the church for blessing. Holy water is sprinkled inside and out, as well as under the hood. Similarly, in Alaska, the fishing boats are sprinkled with holy water at the start of the fishing season as the priest prays for the crews' safety and success. Some Catholics also have a priest bless their cars or homes with holy water as a way of invoking God's blessing and protection.\n\nRosalie Gwathmey\nRosalie Gwathmey or Rosalie Hook (September 15, 1908 \u2013 February 12, 2001) was an American painter and photographer known for her photos of black southern communities around her hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nVan de koele meren des doods\nVan de koele meren des doods (translated in English as The Deeps of Deliverance or Hedwig's Journey, literally Of the cold lakes of death) is a Dutch novel by Frederik van Eeden, first published in 1900.

Charles Boyle received several additional honours in the reign of George I; but having had the misfortune to fall under the suspicion of the government for playing a part in the Jacobite Atterbury Plot, he was committed to the Tower in 1722, where he remained six months, and was then admitted to bail. On a subsequent inquiry he was discharged. Boyle wrote a comedy, \"As you find it\", printed in 1703 and later published together with the plays of the first earl. In 1728, he was listed as one of the subscribers to the \"Cyclopaedia\" of Ephraim Chambers. Boyle died at his house in Westminster in 1731 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He bequeathed his personal library and collection of scientific instruments to Christ Church Library; the instruments are now on display in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. His son John, the 5th Earl of Orrery, succeeded to the earldom of Cork on the failure of the elder branch of the Boyle family, as earl of Cork and Orrery.\n\nGornja Lu\u010dka\nGornja Lu\u010dka is a village in the municipality of Cazin, Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nAlice Gets Stung\nAlice Gets Stung is a 1925 animated short film by Walt Disney in the \"Alice Comedies\" series.

In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" sound.\n\nOmbudsman\nThe Local Government Ombudsman (formally the Commission for Local Government Administration -- there are two Commissioners) for England and Wales was created in 1973, and a similar office for Scotland in 1974; since then, a variety of other public and private sector - specific ombudsmen have been created, along with the Northern Ireland Ombudsman.\n\nGabriel J\u00f6nsson\nGabriel J\u00f6nsson (July 18, 1892 \u2013 April 23, 1984) was a Swedish author and poet, best known for his works inspired by \u00d6resund and farming.\n\n2015 Dunlop World Challenge \u2013 Men's Doubles\nBrydan Klein and Matt Reid won the title, defeating Riccardo Ghedin and Yi Chu- huan in the final 6 \u2013 2, 7 \u2013 6.\n\nAl-Tira, Ramle\nAl- Tira was a Palestinian village in the Ramle Subdistrict.

On March 27, 1942, Congress authorized a nickel made of 50% copper and 50% silver, but gave the Mint the authority to vary the proportions, or add other metals, in the public interest. The Mint's greatest concern was in finding an alloy that would use no nickel, but still satisfy counterfeit detectors in vending machines. An alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese proved suitable, and this alloy began to be coined into nickels from October 1942. In the hope of making them easy to sort out and withdraw after the war, the Mint struck all ``war nickels ''with a large mint mark appearing above Monticello.

Bush, who served as the 41st president from 1989 to 1993. Bush is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States, making him the second son to also become president after his father, the first being John Quincy Adams. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected President of the United States in 2000 when he defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a stopped recount in Florida. He became the fourth person to be elected president while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent. In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush launched a \"War on Terror\" that initially included the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and the Iraq War in 2003. He signed into law broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. In the 2004 presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator John Kerry in a close election.

It is located on NY 17 in Tuxedo, New York, United States, near the gates of the village Tuxedo Park. It educates students from the town of Tuxedo and the village, as well as those from the Greenwood Lake school district in the nearby Town of Warwick. The school imposed a demanding all- Regents curriculum on students before the state Education Department began requiring it. In 2007 the school's future was seriously challenged when voters in the Greenwood Lake and Warwick districts considered the former's proposal to send its high school students to Warwick instead of Tuxedo. Had it passed, Baker would have lost 80% of its students and the district would have had to consider closing the school and sending its own students to another district's high school, possibly Suffern. Greenwood Lake voters approved the plan, but it was rejected in Warwick. In 2015 the school enrollment dropped by over 200 to about 80 students, after Greenwood Lake School District ended its contract to send students to Tuxedo. This caused a drop of$ 2.5 million in the Tuxedo budget. The school planned to expand the Baker school to grades 7- 12. Also in 2015, the school's principal and superintendent resigned their positions.\n\nYou Keep Coming Back Like a Song\n\"You Keep Coming Back Like a Song\" is a popular song written by Irving Berlin for the 1946 film \"Blue Skies\", where it was introduced by Bing Crosby.

It may also be described as a film which does a two-way travel between sky and earth, between comic and experimental, between shadow and light. With humour and multiplying literary references and citations, Godard question himself on life and thus on death, within his kaleidoscope of images.

He was born about 880. That he was Alfred's younger son by Ealhswith is stated by Asser in his biography of the king (893). Asser also provides valuable detail on the boy's upbringing. Whereas his brother Edward and sister \u00c6lfthryth were raised and educated at court, \u00c6thelweard was sent to a type of school (\"schola\"), where he learned to read and write both Latin and Old English and was instructed in the liberal arts \"under the attentive care of teachers, in company with all the nobly born children of virtually the entire area, and a good many of lesser birth as well. \" Such education would have started at an early age, before the onset of adolescence.\nThrough Alfred's patronage, \u00c6thelweard became a wealthy landowner. In his father's will (AD 873 x 888), in which he is unnamed but called Alfred's \"younger son\u00feam gingran minan suna \"), he is the beneficiary of a vast number of estates across the south of Britain: Arreton (Isle of Wight), Dean (i.e. East Dean or West Dean, West Sussex), Meon (i.e. East Meon or West Meon, Hampshire), Amesbury (Wiltshire), Dean (probably West Dean, Wiltshire), Sturminster Marshall (Dorset), Yeovil (Somerset), Crewkerne (Somerset), Whitchurch Canonicorum (Dorset), Axmouth (Devon), Branscombe (Devon), Cullompton (Devon), Tiverton (Devon), \"Mylenburnan\" (probably Burn in Silverton, Devon), Exminster (Devon), \"Su\u00f0eswyr\u00f0e\" (possibly Lustleigh, Devon), Lifton (Devon) and appurtenant lands, i.e. all his father's property in Cornwall, except Triggshire. Since the (late) 890s, \u00c6thelweard attested several of his brother's charters. According to John of Worcester, he died on 16 October 922 and his body received burial at Winchester, where he was soon joined by his brother Edward (d. 924). William of Malmesbury confirms the place of burial, but places his death four years before Edward's. It may have been \u00c6thelweard whose name was entered into the New Minster \"Liber Vitae\", fol. 9v. , with the designation \"clito\u00e6theling\", but if so, he seems to be mistaken for a son of Edward. William tells that \u00c6thelweard had two sons, \u00c6thelwine and \u00c6lfwine, who died fighting in the Battle of Brunanburh and who were buried at Malmesbury, at the behest of their cousin King Athelstan, who was buried there himself only two years later. The connection with this house is prominent in a series of three spurious charters from the Malmesbury archive, in which Athelstan is made to endow the abbey in memory of his \"cousinspatruelia\") \u00c6thelweard, \u00c6lfwine and \u00c6thelwine. If \u00c6lfwine and \u00c6thelwine died childless, their deaths would have brought an end to \u00c6thelweard's direct descent.\n\nLeyland Hodgson\nLeyland Hodgson( 5 October 1892 \u2013 16 March 1949), also known as Leland Hodgson, was an English- born American character actor of the 1930s and 1940s.

He is widely regarded as the most influential and controversial politician in Mexico over the last 30 years. Earlier in his career he worked in the Budget Secretariat, eventually becoming Secretary. He was the PRI presidential candidate in 1988, and was declared elected on 6 July 1988 after accusations of electoral fraud. An economist, Salinas de Gortari was the first Mexican president since 1958 who was not a law graduate. His presidency was characterized by neoliberal, free trade economic policies initiated by his predecessor Miguel de la Madrid, mass privatizations of state- run companies, Mexico's entry into NAFTA, negotiations with the right- wing opposition party PAN to recognize their victories in gubernatorial elections in exchange for supporting Salinas' policies, normalization of relations with the Catholic clergy, and the adoption of a new currency, among other things. After years of economic growth, however, his last year in office revealed Salinas had failed to address social inequity in the country, quickly followed by revelations of Salinas's mismanagement. The year 1994 saw the Zapatista uprising, the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio( Salinas's hand- picked successor and PRI candidate for the 1994 presidential elections), and the murder of secretary- general of the PRI Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu( Salinas's brother- in- law). This surge of political violence led to economic uncertainty. Facing pressures to devalue the peso, Salinas stood firm, opting for a strategy he believed would help his candidacy for the presidency of the newly created World Trade Organization. As a consequence, less than a month after Salinas left office, Mexico entered into the worst economic crisis of its history. Shortly after, his brother Ra\u00fal Salinas de Gortari was arrested for ordering the assassination of Ruiz Massieu and was subsequently indicted on charges of drug trafficking. Carlos Salinas de Gortari then left the country for many years. Salinas de Gortari is often referred to as the most unpopular former president of Mexico. A 2005 nationwide poll conducted by Parametr\u00eda found that 73% of the respondents had a negative image of Salinas de Gortari, while only 9% stated that they had a positive image of the former president.\n\nDemented World\nDemented World was a comedy CD put out by Gregg Hughes and Anthony Cumia that features bits from their Opie and Anthony radio show.

He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I. During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called \"Cihuacoatl\" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive \"Tlatoque\", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Dur\u00e1n). Dur\u00e1n also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands.\n\nZelda Fitzgerald\nZelda Fitzgerald (July 24, 1900 \u2013 March 10, 1948) was an American novelist, socialite, painter and wife of author F.

The immediate success of Scott's first novel \"This Side of Paradise\" (1920) brought them into contact with high society, but their marriage was plagued by wild drinking, infidelity and bitter recriminations. Ernest Hemingway, whom Zelda disliked, blamed her for Scott's declining literary output, though her extensive diaries provided much material for his fiction. After being diagnosed with schizophrenia, she was increasingly confined to specialist clinics, and the couple were living apart when Scott died suddenly in 1940. Zelda died seven years later in a fire at the hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, in which she was a patient.

A rival Arab nationalism also claimed rights over the former Ottoman territories and sought to prevent Jewish migration into Palestine, leading to growing Arab -- Jewish tensions. Israeli independence in 1948 was marked by massive migration of Jews from Europe, a Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries to Israel, and of Arabs from Israel, followed by the Arab -- Israeli conflict.

In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called Labryaden, \"the double-axe men\", which indicates Minoan origin. The double-axe, labrys, was the holy symbol of the Cretan labyrinth. The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. Apollo Delphinios was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands, and his name indicates his connection with Delphi and the holy serpent Delphyne (\"womb\").[citation needed] Apollo's sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with Britomartis (Diktynna), the Minoan \"Mistress of the animals\". In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the \"Mister of the animals\", a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute.

Wilson called the film\" very factual.\" He had little involvement with its making, whereas Ledbetter was relied upon for the 1980s portions. The cast and crew maintained that nothing in the film was a\" Hollywood\" embellishment and that everything was intended to be as factual as possible. Conversely, Landy's son Evan felt that his father was unfairly portrayed. Some minor historical inaccuracies were noted by critics, a number of which relate to the minimal coverage devoted to Wilson's family and collaborators. Ledbetter said that Landy's treatment of Wilson\" was even worse\" than the film portrays. \" Love and Mercy\" premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2014 and was released by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions on June 5, 2015.

Known as \"the American Clausewitz,\" and \"the original nuclear strategist,\" he was an initial architect of nuclear deterrence strategy and tried to ascertain the role and value of nuclear weapons after their creation. Brodie was initially a strong supporter of the concept of escalating responses; he promoted the view that a war in Europe would be started with conventional forces and escalate to nuclear only if and when necessary. After a meeting with French counterparts in 1960, he came to espouse a very different policy, one based purely on nuclear deterrence with the stated position that the US would use nuclear arms at the first instance of hostilities of any sort. Brodie felt that anything short of this seriously eroded the concept of deterrence and might lead to situations where one side might enter hostilities believing it could remain non-nuclear. This change in policy made Brodie increasingly at odds with his contemporaries.\n\nTalal of Jordan\nTalal bin Abdullah (26 February 1909 \u2013 7 July 1972) was King of Jordan from the assassination of his father, King Abdullah I, on 20 July 1951, until he was forced to abdicate on 11 August 1952. According to Talal, he was a 39th-generation direct descendant of Muhammad as he belongs to the Hashemite family\u2014who have ruled Jordan since 1921. Talal was born in Mecca as the eldest child of Abdullah and his wife Musbah bint Nasser. Abdullah was son of Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca, who led the Great Arab Revolt during World War I against the Ottoman Empire in 1916. After removing Ottoman rule, Abdullah established the Emirate of Transjordan in 1921, which became a British Protectorate, and ruled as its Emir. During Abdullah's absence, Talal spent his early years alone with his mother. Talal received private education in Amman, later joining Transjordan's Arab Legion as second lieutenant in 1927. He then became aide to his grandfather Sharif Hussein, the ousted King of the Hejaz, during his exile in Cyprus. By 1948, Talal became a general in the Arab Legion. Abdullah sought independence in 1946, and the Emirate became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Talal became Crown Prince upon his father's designation as King of Jordan. Abdullah was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951, and Talal became King. Talal's most revered achievement as King is the establishment of Jordan's modern constitution in 1952, rendering his kingdom as a constitutional monarchy. He ruled for less than thirteen months until he was forced to abdicate by Parliament due to mental illness\u2014reported as schizophrenia.

He pastored several churches in the Baptist denomination in three provinces, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. In 1967, he married Louise Plester from Chemainus, British Columbia and they raised eight children \u2014 four children of their own as well as four foster children, three of whom are First Nations. Along with his wife, they fostered more than 155 children. Elley joined the Reform Party of Canada, then led by Preston Manning, in 1988 discovering that his political, social and faith views were very much aligned with Manning whom he admired. His first political activity was in 1992, when he ran a Vote No campaign on behalf of the Reform Party in the federal riding of Calgary Centre during the Charlottetown Accord constitutional referendum which he and the Party won. He then became an area manager for the Reform candidate Jim Silye. During that time he and his family moved to Vancouver Island, where he became involved in the winning campaign of Bob Ringma in 1993. After the election, he was asked to become president of the Nanaimo \u2014 Cowichan constituency association for the Reform Party. He was nominated as the Reform candidate in Nanaimo- Cowichan in 1997 and won in that year's federal election. He was re-elected in 2000 in what the local press described as a landslide win as a member of the Canadian Alliance party, and ended his career as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. As MP, he served as deputy critic for Health and Vice Chair of the Health Committee for three years. He became senior critic for Indian Affairs and Northern Development under Stockwell Day's leadership. When Stephen Harper became leader of the Party in 2002, Elley became senior critic for Labour and continued on the Committee for Persons with Disabilities. Elley was a social conservative whose staunch opposition to same- sex marriage became a source for controversy when he was in Parliament. In 2000, as Parliament debated extending rights to same- sex couple, Elley suggested homosexuality should never have been legalized. Elley blamed former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's decision to decriminalize homosexuality in 1969 for what he said was an assault on the traditional family. Elley said:\" He and his cohorts passed omnibus legislation which legitimized behaviour which up until then had been considered outside the realm of normal.\" Elley stood by those remarks, later telling a Vancouver Sun reporter:\" I presented my views on the breakdown of society as I saw it. \u2026 I had deep concerns about the erosion of traditional values and I ... still continue to stand up for traditional family values.\" He ran in the 2008 general election but was not successful, finishing second to New Democratic Party candidate Jean Crowder by more than 4,000 votes. In 2011, he was elected president of the fledgling BC Conservative Party and held the position for a year.

The Rocky Mountains form a large portion of the Western U.S., entering from Canada and stretching nearly to Mexico. The Rocky Mountain region is the highest region of the United States by average elevation. The Rocky Mountains generally contain fairly mild slopes and wider peaks compared to some of the other great mountain ranges, with a few exceptions (such as the Teton Mountains in Wyoming and the Sawatch Range in Colorado). The highest peaks of the Rockies are found in Colorado, the tallest peak being Mount Elbert at 14,440 ft (4,400 m). The Rocky Mountains contain some of the most spectacular, and well known scenery in the world. In addition, instead of being one generally continuous and solid mountain range, it is broken up into a number of smaller, intermittent mountain ranges, forming a large series of basins and valleys.\n\nAmerican International School of Dhaka\nThe American International School Dhaka( AISD) is an independent co-educational day school located in Baridhara, Dhaka, Bangladesh, serving students of all nationalities in pre-kindergarten through grade 12.\n\nEdgar Wallace\nRichard Horatio Edgar Wallace( 1 April 1875 \u2013 10 February 1932) was an English writer. Born into poverty as an illegitimate London child, Wallace left school at the age of 12. He joined the army at age 21 and was a war correspondent during the Second Boer War, for Reuters and the\" Daily Mail\". Struggling with debt, he left South Africa, returned to London, and began writing thrillers to raise income, publishing books including\" The Four Just Men\"( 1905). Drawing on his time as a reporter in the Congo, covering the Belgian atrocities, Wallace serialised short stories in magazines such as\" The Windsor Magazine\" and later published collections such as\" Sanders of the River\"( 1911). He signed with Hodder and Stoughton in 1921 and became an internationally recognised author. After an unsuccessful bid to stand as Liberal MP for Blackpool( as one of David Lloyd George's Independent Liberals) in the 1931 general election, Wallace moved to Hollywood, where he worked as a script writer for RKO. He died suddenly from undiagnosed diabetes, during the initial drafting of\" King Kong\"( 1933). Wallace was such a prolific writer that one of his publishers claimed that a quarter of all books in England were written by him. As well as journalism, Wallace wrote screen plays, poetry, historical non-fiction, 18 stage plays, 957 short stories, and over 170 novels, 12 in 1929 alone. More than 160 films have been made of Wallace's work. As well as the creation of King Kong, he is remembered as a writer of' the colonial imagination', for the J. G. Reeder detective stories, and for\" The Green Archer\" serial. He sold over 50 million copies of his combined works in various editions, and\" The Economist\" describes him as\" one of the most prolific thriller writers of[ the 20th] century\", although the great majority of his books are out of print in the UK, but are still read in Germany.\n\nRaymond McKee\nRaymond McKee (born Eldon Raymond McKee; December 7, 1892 \u2013 October 3, 1984) was an American actor. He appeared in 173 films between 1912 and 1935. His film debut was in \"The Lovers' Signal\" (1912). During the production of \"The Unbeliever\" in 1918, McKee worked with his future wife, Marguerite Courtot. They worked again in the 1922 \"Down to the Sea in Ships\". They married after the production of the film and were wed for 60 years until his death in 1984. McKee died in Long Beach, California from pneumonia, aged 91.

There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort\u2014the Theodosian Code\u2014was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests. At the emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of most of Italy, North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.\n\nWhat nationality of the company that published Personalized Medicine (Journal)?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics, was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of this Outer Planet. Both the HST and AO telescopes on Earth has made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the Outer Planets for example. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.\n\nGlen L. Urban\nGlen L.

He started his reign as an infant under the regency of his mother, who was in an uneasy alliance with Clothar's uncle King Guntram of Burgundy (d. 592). Clothar assumed full power over Neustria upon the death of his mother, in 597; though rich this was one of the smallest portions of Francia. He continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution in an especially brutal manner in 613, after winning the battle that enabled Chlothar to unite Francia under his rule. Like his father, he built up his territories by moving in after the deaths of other kings. His reign was long by contemporary standards, but saw the continuing erosion of royal power to the nobility and the church against a backdrop of feuding among the Merovingians. The Edict of Paris in 614, concerned with several aspects of appointments to offices and the administration of the kingdom, has been interpreted in different ways by modern historians. In 617 he made the mayor of the Palace a role held for life, an important step in the progress of this office from being first the manager of the royal household to the effective head of government, and eventually the monarch, under Pepin the Short in 751. Chlothar was forced to cede rule over Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I in 623. Unusually for a Merovingian monarch, he practised monogamy, though deaths meant that he had three wives. He was generally an ally of the church and, perhaps inspired by the example of his uncle Guntram, his reign seems to lack the outrageous acts of murder perpetrated by many of his relations, the execution of Brunhilda excepted.\n\nYuxar\u0131 Noxudlu\nYuxar\u0131 Noxudlu( also, Yukhary Nokhudlu and Verkhniye Nokhudly) is a village and municipality in the Salyan Rayon of Azerbaijan.
