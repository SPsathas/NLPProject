To help ally himself with the House of Malatesta, Giovanni Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan married Antonia in the city of Brescia in 1408. They had no issue. After Giovanni Maria\u2019s assassination in 1412, the succeeding Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, permitted Antonia to continue sharing the governance of the duchy for a few months. Although she soon retired to Cesena, she retained her title, Duchess of Milan.\n\nLucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (consul 33)\nLucius Cornelius Sulla Felix was a Roman senator of the first century AD. He was a \"consul ordinarius\" in AD 33 as the colleague of Galba, the future emperor. Felix was the son of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Faustus, and a great-grandnephew of the famed statesman Lucius Cornelius Sulla. His mother was Sextia and his older brother was Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus. Felix may be the Lucius Sulla Tacitus describes under the year 21 as coming into conflict with the future general Domitius Corbulo over who was of higher rank at a gladiatorial show. \"Corbulo had age, national usage, and the feelings of the older senators in his favor,\" writes Tacitus. \" Against him Mamercus Scaurus, Lucius Arruntius and other kinsmen of Sulla strenuously exerted themselves. \" The matter was brought to the Senate where arguments filled the room until Drusus intervened and brought the body back to order. The matter was resolved when both Sulla and Scaurus apologized to Corbulo. Ronald Syme argues for this identification, and as Scaurus is identified as Felix's uncle and step-father, concludes that Scaurus had married his mother Sextia after the death of his father, and the grandfather of Felix and the father of Scaurus had married the same woman. An inscription recorded at Pisidian Antioch describes Felix as brother-in-law to Germanicus; Ronald Syme interprets this as proof that he was briefly married to Agrippina the Younger between the death of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus in the year 41 and her marriage to Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus.\n\nWilliam Christopher of Baden-Baden\nMargrave William Christopher of Baden( born 12 October 1628 in Baden- Baden; died: 25 August 1652) was a margrave of Baden and canon at Cologne.

In 1902, he co-founded the Democratic Republican Alliance, the most important centre-right party under the Third Republic, becoming Prime Minister in 1912 and serving as President of the Republic from 1913 to 1920. He single-handedly controlled French foreign policy from 1912 to the beginning of World War I, being noted for his strongly anti-German attitudes, visiting Russia in 1912 and 1914 to repair Franco-Russian relations, which had become strained over the Bosnian Crisis of 1908 and the Agadir Crisis of 1911, and giving France's support for Russian military mobilization during the July Crisis of 1914.

He continued to travel even after becoming blind, particularly along the western coast of the Arabian peninsula. It was then that he turned to the writing of panegyrics as a means of support.

Even before the time of Mohammed he is said to have believed in the Resurrection and Last Judgment, and to have been a monotheist. These beliefs may have been due to his interactions with the bishop of Najr\u0101n and the' Ib\u0101dites( Christians) of Al- Hirah.

The series was the result of three short experimental films that Max Fleischer independently produced in the period of 1914 \u2013 1916 to demonstrate his invention, the Rotoscope, which was a device consisting of a film projector and easel used as an aid for achieving realistic movement for animated cartoons. The Rotoscope would project motion picture film through an opening in the easel, covered by a glass pane serving as a drawing surface. The image on the projected film was traced onto paper, advancing the film one frame at a time as each drawing would be made. Fleischer's younger brother Dave Fleischer, who was working as a clown at Coney Island, served as the model for their first famous character, eventually known as\" Koko the Clown.\" \" Out of the Inkwell\" began at the Bray Studio as a monthly entry in\" The Bray Pictorgraph Screen Magazine\" produced for Paramount from 1918, and later for Goldwyn from 1920 to 1921. In that same year, The Fleischer brothers started their own studio, and in 1923, the clown who previously had no name came to be known as KO- KO when animation veteran Dick Huemer became the new Director of Animation. Huemer, who began his animation career with the\" Mutt and Jeff\" cartoons in 1916, brought the influence of the short and tall companions to\" Out of the Inkwell\" with the creation of a small canine companion named Fitz, who would later evolve into Bimbo in the sound era. Huemer redesigned the clown for animation, which reduced the Fleischer's dependency on the Rotoscope for fluid animation. He also defined the drawing style with his distinctive inking quality that the series was famous for. But it was the interaction of the live action sequences with the artist/ creator, Max Fleischer and his pen and ink creations that was the foundation of the series. Typically, the cartoons start out with live action showing Max drawing the characters on paper, or opening the inkwell to release the characters into\" reality.\" The\" Out of the Inkwell\" series ran from 1918 to mid 1927, and was renamed\" The Inkwell Imps\" for Paramount, continuing until 1929. In all, 62\" Out of the Inkwell\" and 56\" Inkwell Imps\" films were produced within 11 years. \" The Inkwell Imps\" series was replaced by the\" Talkartoons\" in 1929, and Koko was retired until 1931, appearing as a supporting character with Bimbo and Betty Boop. Koko's last theatrical appearance was in the Betty Boop cartoon,\" Ha- Ha- Ha\"( 1934), which was a remake of the silent\" Out of the Inkwell\" film,\" The Cure\"( 1924). Koko had a brief cameo in his only color theatrical appearance in the\" Screen Song\" entry,\" Toys will be Toys\"( 1949). In 1950, Stuart Productions released a number of the Inkwell Studios\" Out of the Inkwell\" cartoons, and a selection of the Paramount\" Inkwell Imps\" cartoons to television. In 1955, the\" Inkwell Imps\", along with 2,500 pre-October 1950 Paramount shorts and cartoons were sold to television packagers, the majority acquired by U.M.& M. TV Corporation. In 1958, Max Fleischer reactivated his studio in a partnership with Hal Seeger, and in 1960 produced a series of 100\" Out Of The Inkwell\" five- minute cartoons.

The Xinhua News Agency claimed that Windows 8 was being banned in protest of Microsoft's support lifecycle policy and the end of support for Windows XP (which, as of January 2014, had a market share of 49% in China), as the government \"obviously cannot ignore the risks of running OS [sic] without guaranteed technical support.\" However, Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had also previously warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government due to its heavy use of internet-based services.\n\nGene\nAdditionally, genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.\n\nWhy Does Herr R.

It was similar to the style\" Monsieur\", which was typically used by the King's second son. Just as Gaston, duc d'Orl\u00e9ans( 1608 \u2013 1660), the second son of King Henry IV of France( 1553 \u2013 1610), was known as\" Monsieur\", Elisabeth of Bourbon( 1602 \u2013 1644), the eldest daughter of Henry, was known before her marriage to King Philip IV of Spain( 1605 \u2013 1665) as\" Madame Royale\". After her death, the title was borne by her younger sister, Christine Marie of France( 1606 \u2013 1663), until her marriage to Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy( 1587 \u2013 1637). The most famous holder of this honorific was King Louis XVI of France's eldest daughter, Marie- Th\u00e9r\u00e8se- Charlotte( 1778 \u2013 1851), the only one of his immediate family to survive the French Revolution. She later married her cousin, Louis- Antoine, duc d'Angoul\u00eame( 1775 \u2013 1844), and played a prominent role during the Bourbon Restoration. The style\" Madame Royale\" was not regulated by any other code than that of etiquette. Its very simplicity, however, was considered more desirable than being known more formally as\" Son Altesse RoyaleYour Royal Highness\") in conversation. The style was customarily held until the death of the royal parent or until the princess married. The equivalent style in Great Britain is\" Princess Royal\". This title came into existence when Queen Henrietta Maria( 1609 \u2013 1669), another daughter of King Henry IV of France, and the wife of King Charles I of England( 1600 \u2013 1649), wanted to imitate in the Kingdom of England the way in which the eldest daughter of the sovereign in France was styled\" Madame Royale.\" In Savoy, Henrietta Maria's older sister, Christine Marie of France, became known as Madama Reale in reference to her French manner of address. Her daughter- in- law, Marie Jeanne of Savoy, when she became regent of Savoy after the early death of her husband, called herself Madama Reale, after her mother- in- law, who had also been a regent of Savoy. This was despite the fact that Marie Jeanne's father was not a king.\n\nOn Top of Spaghetti\n\" On Top of Spaghetti\" is a ballad and children's song with the best- known performance by folk singer Tom Glazer with the Do- Re- Mi Children's Chorus in 1963.

In order to be able to compete economically with other regions and to acquire a sufficiently strong position to be able preserve their economic independence, the Flemish people must have\" intellectual tools\", such as a Flemish university. Together with its friends of\" Geen Taal Geen Vrijheid\" he created a Flemish\" University Extension\". In 1899, he graduated in economic sciences at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles. In the same period he had been involved in the establishment of the Flemish society\" Eendracht is Macht\" and the Flemish publication\" Schild en Vriend\"( E: shield and friend).

He also appeared regularly on Sky News' weekly\" Technofile\" programme, reviewing gadgets alongside presenter Martin Stanford. He was also a regular contributor to\" Media Network\", a communications magazine on the English service of Radio Netherlands. Tomalski started his broadcasting career on the south west London pirate scene of the 1970s, where he became best known as the host of Roger Tate's Mailbox Show on European Music Radio, later becoming a licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign G6CQF. His maisonette in Mitcham, Surrey was equipped with a broadcast- quality mixing desk and two Nakamichi cassette decks, alongside the high- quality turntables. These were complemented by a collection of several thousand albums, mainly of his favourite genre; soul and funk, but topped up with many chart albums and a few hundred 60s and 70s rock records. He was also a collector of state of the art video equipment. He was a co-founder of Wandle Valley Radio( WVR) in 1984, still under the pseudonym\" Roger Tate\", broadcasting a soul/ funk/ hi-energy programme- he was a friend of the hi-energy artist Hazell Dean- alongside Alan Rogers and Paul James( both pseudonyms for obvious reasons). He provided the studio facilities for the station, which was amongst the pioneers of microwave links from the studio to the FM Band II transmitter, a technology later very widely used in pirate radio. Another technology which Tomalski pioneered was that of computer data transmission via Band II FM radio- raw data transmitted onto the audio signal with no subcarrier: WVR featured the\" Roger Tate Computer Program Programme\" with Tomalski introducing( after the music had ended for the night) half an hour of 8- bit data sounds played from a Nakamichi cassette deck, representing programs for the BBC Micro and the Tandy TRS- 80 microcomputers, among others. Surprisingly, for such an innovation being broadcast into listeners homes late at night, the telephone and postal feedback on the programme was overwhelmingly positive; a tribute to Tomalski's broadcasting skills. His home studio was raided in the late 80s after alleged transmission offences, and the Home Office even went as far as confiscating his electric kettle( as well as the studio gear), on the grounds that it was connected to the same ring main as his transmitting equipment. In his subsequent radio career, Tomalski was a regular contributor to\" You and Yours\" and\" The Big Byte\" on BBC Radio.

The system was co-developed by WGBH and Rufus Butler Seder. On the way into the theatre, viewers pick up a reflective plastic panel mounted on a flexible stalk. The panel sits in a seat cupholder or on the floor adjacent to the seat. A large LED display is mounted on a rear wall that displays caption characters in mirror image. Viewers move the panels into position( usually below the movie screen) so they can read the reflected captions and watch the movie. It is sometimes necessary to sit in a certain area of the theater to obtain the best angle for reflecting the backward text emitted from the back of the theater on the panel while also being able to view the movie at the same time. Through this method, all screenings of a film can be accessible to caption viewers. Others seated alongside do not watch, or usually even see, the captions. Rear Window captioning is an alternative to open captioning, in which text is permanently visible. Open captioning has been little- used due to the fear that it was too intrusive and noticeable to hearing viewers. However, no studies have been conducted to elicit hearing people's opinions on how they will adapt to reading captions on screen. Rear Window captioning is a form of closed captioning because the viewer must choose to view the captions. Few movie exhibitors or theater chains choose to provide Rear Window captioning. One of the reasons often stated for not providing Rear Window captioning is the cost of the hardware( as of 2011, approximately US$ 4,500 per screen for a single installation, less for multiple installations in a multiplex). The cost of captioning a film is on the order of US$ 4,000( about$ 40 per minute). For blind viewers, audio description( Descriptive Video Service, DVS) can be and usually is transmitted along with captions. Viewers listen to the descriptions via wireless headsets.

Salvidienus became one of the most trusted of Octavian \u2019s generals during the civil wars following Caesar \u2019s death. In 42 BC he commanded the fleet of Octavian against Sextus Pompeius, who had taken control of Sicily and was harassing the coasts of Italy. However, Salvidienus was defeated in a naval battle fought off Rhegium, largely because of the inexperience of his crews. On Octavian's return from Greece after the Battle of Philippi, Salvidienus was sent to Spain with six legions, but he hastily retreated to Italy to oppose Lucius Antonius and Fulvia( Antony's wife), who had taken up arms against Octavian, starting the so- called Perusian War. Salvidienus captured and destroyed the city of Sentinum and then, with Agrippa, surrounded Lucius Antonius's forces in Perusia. The other Antonian generals, who had no clear orders from Antony, remained out of the struggle, and Lucius Antonius was forced to surrender after a few months' siege( winter of 40 BC). After the end of the Perusian War, Octavian sent Salvidienus to Gaul as a governor, with a large army of eleven legions. He was also designated as consul for 39 BC, although he had not reached senatorial rank. Despite all these honours, when Antony came from the East with large forces to confront Octavian, Salvidienus offered to desert to Antony with his legions. Apparently this proposal came after Antony had already made an agreement with Octavian( the Pact of Brundisium). Antony revealed to Octavian the treachery of Salvidienus, who was accused of high treason in the Senate and condemned to death in the fall of 40 BC. He was either executed or committed suicide, as reported by Appian, Livy, and Dio.\n\nJules Brasseur\nJules Brasseur was a French actor and singer, born 1829 in Paris and died in the same city in 1890, who achieved considerable popular success in Paris and around France in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nJan Rubens\nJan Rubens( 1530 \u2013 1587) was a Flemish magistrate of Antwerp, best known today as the father of Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nWhere was the director of film At The End Of The Tunnel born?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Surveys of leading economists show overwhelming agreement that Brexit will likely reduce the UK's real per - capita income level. A 2017 survey of existing academic literature found ``the research literature displays a broad consensus that in the long run Brexit will make the United Kingdom poorer because it will create new barriers to trade, foreign direct investment, and immigration.

He adopted the Latinized name of Noviomagus, possibly suggesting that he came from the town of Nijmegen, called\" Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum\" by the Romans. In 1561, Santbech compiled a collected edition of the works of Regiomontanus( 1436 \u2013 1476),\" De triangulis planis et sphaericis libri quinque\"( first published in 1533) and\" Compositio tabularum sinum recto\", as well as Santbech's own\" Problematum astronomicorum et geometricorum sectiones septem\". It was published in Basel by Henrich Petri and Petrus Perna. Santbech's work consisted of studies on astronomy, sundials, surveying, and levelling for water courses. It also includes descriptions of astronomical instruments, information for navigators and geographers, and general information about astronomy in the first years after Nicolaus Copernicus. Santbech also studied the subject of gunnery and ballistics as a theoretic discourse as well as for the practical application of war, and utilized the foundations of geometry, with ample references to Euclid and Ptolemy, in order to do so. Santbech seem not to have been aware of similar studies by Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia. Santbech's text included theoretical illustrations of trajectories. These were depicted with abruptly acute angles and straight lines, allowing him to create a right- angled triangle from which ranges were computed with the help of a table of sines. Santbech was of course fully aware that a cannonball's true trajectory would not consist of a straight line and a sudden drop, but these depictions were meant to assist with mathematical calculations. In 1651, Riccioli gave Santbech's name to the crater Santbech on the Moon.\n\nCricket World Cup\nThe finals of the World Cup are contested by the ten full members of the ICC (all of which are Test - playing teams) and a number of teams made up from associate and affiliate members of the ICC, selected via the World Cricket League and a later qualifying tournament.

The chord structure, melody, and lyrics are all completely different. Brel \u2019s song was written in the key of A minor, in 3/ 4 time. It is a slow, haunting story of a man trying to win back his former lover\u2014a song about the cowardice of men according to Brel. In contrast, Spektor \u2019s song is lively, in 4/ 4 time, and in a major key. Its lyrics evoke a carefree jaunt through various neighborhoods of New York City, the narrator describing all the beautiful and interesting things encountered along the way. Somehow the narrator ends up in the caf\u00e9s and gardens of Paris, and the song ends with repeated declarations of love for Paris in the rain. The song was previously released on Spektor's 2002 album\" Songs\", simply titled\" Ne Me Quitte Pas\". This version of the song featured just Spektor and her piano, while the 2012 version includes a drum machine, horns and brass instruments. The song also features lyrics sung in both English and French, evident in the title. In June 2012, Spektor released yet another version of the song online, keeping the multi-instrument production heard on\" What We Saw from the Cheap Seats\", but replacing the English verses with Russian lyrics. The new rendition was titled\" \u041d\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0439 \u041c\u0435\u043d\u044f\". The song can be heard at the end of the episode\" Five Miles From Yetzer Hara\" from the eighth season of\" Weeds\".\n\nPatrick Wey\nPatrick Sean Wey (born March 21, 1991) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman.

The economic transition after the German reunification in 1990 led to the closure of most large-scale factories and companies, leaving small and medium-sized ones to dominate the manufacturing sector. Well-known industrial centres are Jena (a world centre for optical instruments with companies like Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik) and Eisenach, where BMW started its car production in the 1920s and an Opel factory is based today. The most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking, vehicle production and food industries. Especially the small and mid-sized towns in central and southwestern Thuringia (e.g. Arnstadt, Schmalkalden and Ohrdruf) are highly industrialised, whereas there are fewer industrial companies in the northern and eastern parts of the Land. Traditional industries like production of glass, porcelain and toys collapsed during the economic crises between 1930 and 1990.\n\nI've Been Everywhere\n\" I've Been Everywhere\" is a song which was written by Australian country singer Geoff Mack in 1959, and made popular by Lucky Starr in 1962.
