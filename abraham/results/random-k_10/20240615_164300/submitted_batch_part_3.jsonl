She was arrested on pimping charges in 1976. A police investigation soon revealed that many of Hopp's customers were well-known politicians and other dignitaries. In November 1977, the newspaper \"Dagens Nyheter\" published allegations citing Justice Minister Lennart Geijer as one of Doris Hopp's customers. The newspaper claimed as its source a classified report in which the chief of police Carl Persson had informed Prime Minister Olof Palme of the involvement of politicians in the prostitution scandal. At the time of the scandal broke, it was legal to pay for sexual services, but the fact that politicians socialized with prostitutes was viewed as a security risk as staff from foreign embassies were also reported to frequent the brothel. Prime Minister Palme strongly denied the allegations, accusing the newspaper of aggravated libel. The newspaper was forced into a retreat and two days after the publication Lennart Geijer received an official apology. Years later, it emerged that a few minor details aside, the newspaper's assertions had in fact been largely correct. Over the years, there has been much speculation regarding the identities of those who made use of the brothel's services.

Hugh Brock was a conscientious objector in World War II. In May 1940, in the face of new defence regulations and demands in parliament for the banning of\" Peace News\", its printer refused to continue printing it and, at the same time, the Wholesale Newsagent Association, which handled two- thirds of the circulation, refused to distribute it any longer. Alternative printing arrangements were made by the editor, Humphrey Moore, and Hugh and his brother, Ashley,( A H Brock) agreed to ignore any potential threat under the regulations and, with peace groups across Britain, created an efficient voluntary distribution chain. Brock took on the role of assistant editor of\" Peace News\" in 1946 and became editor in 1955. He shifted the focus of Peace News towards campaigning for nuclear disarmament, nonviolent direct action and the movement for colonial freedom. In 1955 he appointed the American academic Gene Sharp to Peace News to cover the Civil Rights Movement. At that time the newspaper was the official organ of the Peace Pledge Union( PPU) but this formal link was broken in 1961. He left\" Peace News\" in 1964. Between 1946 and 1952\" Peace News\" published more than 160 articles dedicated to the discussion of Gandhi's relevance to the West. During the 1950s Hugh Brock played a significant role in the growth of nonviolent protest in Britain. In November 1949 the PPU had set up a Nonviolence Commission to study nonviolent resistance and the ideas of Gandhi. In December 1951 some members formed' Operation Gandhi' to organise nonviolent direct action directly inspired by Gandhi. Among their aims were the withdrawal of US troops from Britain and an end to Britain's production of atomic weapons. Brock was secretary of this group. Its activities began with a sit- down outside the War Office on 11 January 1952. Eleven protesters squatted in front of the War Office, having first notified the police. The protesters did not resist arrest and pleaded guilty to the charges against them, following principles of nonviolence. There were other protests at Aldermaston, Mildenhall, Porton Down and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. The protest march to Aldermaston in 1952 involved just 35 people and paved the way for the much larger Aldermaston Marches that began in 1958. In 1957 Hugh Brock was one of a committee that arranged protests against British testing of the H-bomb on Christmas Island in the Pacific. The committee later became the Direct Action Committee, which organised the 1958 Aldermaston March. With the formation in 1960 of the Committee of 100, which organised civil disobedience against nuclear weapons on a larger scale, the Direct Action Committee merged into the new organisation. After leaving\" Peace News\" Brock continued to be involved with peace campaigning until his death in 1985.

The Hugh Brock Memorial Library, Kitwe Zambia, was established in his memory.\n\nChannel 4\nChannel 4 is a British public - service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982.

A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called middle names. In English- speaking American culture, that term is often applied( arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a\" middle name\", and is actually( to mention several types of common cases): In the United States, such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, patronymics, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the\" middle name\" is often abbreviated to the middle initial( e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for signatures) or omitted entirely in everyday use( e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings. It is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English- speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century( and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender James Francis Edward Stuart( 1688 \u2013 1766). Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase\" middle name\" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical\" Harvardiana\". The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently by the increased use of computer databases that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such databases under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like Mar\u00eda del Pilar Pereyra or Mar\u00eda de las Nieves Garc\u00eda. The abbreviation\" N.M.N.\"( no middle name) or\" N.M.I.\"( no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name. Since 1905,\" middle name\" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase\" discretion is my middle name.\"\n\nThe New Fantastic Four\nThe New Fantastic Four( on- screen title: The Fantastic Four) is an animated series produced by DePatie \u2013 Freleng Enterprises and Marvel Comics Animation( both owned by Marvel Entertainment) in 1978.\n\nGug Tappeh, Bukan\nGug Tappeh( also Romanized as G\u016bg Tappeh; also known as Gog Tappeh) is a village in Akhtachi- ye Mahali Rural District, Simmineh District, Bukan County, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran.

It was the final theatrical film directed by Gilles Carle. The film stars Chlo\u00e9 Sainte- Marie as Yo- Yo and Louis- Philippe Davignon- Daigneault as Alphonse, a New Age cult priestess in Montreal and her faith healer nephew. Events are set in motion when Alphonse's father Aristide( Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9veill\u00e9) threatens to commit suicide by jumping off the Jacques Cartier Bridge, leading to an ad hoc neighbourhood referendum on whether or not he should jump. The film is in part a satire of the political and social rhetoric, on both sides of the issue, in the 1995 Quebec referendum; Carle was inspired by, and singled out for special opprobrium in his film, the notion offered by some of his sovereignist friends that Quebec independence would in and of itself solve the social problems of poverty, unemployment and homelessness. The film garnered two Genie Award nominations at the 17th Genie Awards in 1996, in the categories of Best Screenplay( Carle) and Best Costume Design( Denis Sperdouklis).\n\nThe Bronx\nThe Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, in the West Bronx, is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space, built on a 17 acres (7 ha) site that formerly held the Bronx Terminal Market, a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention, south of Yankee Stadium.

Her training method is based on the theory that dogs, being descended from wolves, fit the social model of the pack- an ordered hierarchy with a clearly defined leader. She believes that dogs are unable to understand any other social model, and when co-opted into human families as pets still see themselves as pack members. Fennell argues that most inappropriate dog behavior arises if the owner does not consistently signal that he or she is' pack leader'. Theoretically this makes the dog anxious: it can not conceive of a leaderless pack, and so if its owner abdicates leadership the dog has no option but to try to take on the' alpha' role itself. In the attempt it may become aggressive or difficult to handle, as it tries to assert dominance; hyperactive, through uncertainty on what it should be doing, or sometimes acutely stressed. Other dog experts have cited recent scientific research to challenge the theory that dog behavior is based on the model of the wolf pack, criticizing this as an over-simplification. Due to this, many of Fennell's beliefs are considered dated and archaic, no longer being scientifically accurate. Fennell's method, called Amichien Bonding( from the French' ami', meaning' friend' and' chien', meaning' dog'), emphasizes learning the signals( in her opinion) by which dogs recognize leadership, and using them consistently so that the dog perceives the owner as' alpha' and itself as subordinate. It can then possibly trust its owner to take decisions and will become contented and relaxed. Fennell does not believe in physically dominating or chastising the dog. Amichien Bonding essentially means the dog is consistently shown by the owner that the human half of the partnership is responsible for making decisions. The dog is not physically dominated, but is trained through, among other behaviors, ignoring the animal at certain times: this is done to reassure it that it is not the one responsible for leadership and decision- making. There is dispute over whether this type of training program can have negative effects and it has been called\" psychologically cruel\" by one author. Other dog trainers/ owners believe it is a harmless and effective way of indicating to the dog which behaviors are acceptable and which are not.\n\nAlice Havers\nAlice Mary Havers( her name before marriage and professionally), married name Alice Mary Morgan( 1850 \u2013 26 August 1890 London), was an English painter and illustrator.\n\nWhere did the presenter of Tim Russert (Talk Show) die?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Stevens was recovering during what amounted to nearly a year of convalescence, after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung and tuberculosis. He spent three months in King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, England, transferring afterward to another nine months of bedrest at home. Stevens, who was near death at the time he was admitted in the hospital, used the time he was recuperating for contemplation, and wrote dozens of songs, including\" Trouble\", many of which were recorded much later. When he was hospitalized, Stevens was often alone in a very spare and plain room. He was told that at the time he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him. The effect on the 19- year- old pop star was pronounced. He said,\" To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut.\" The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folk- rock emphasis. While recovering, Stevens donated his spare time, and some of his newer, more introspective songs for Colin Higgins and Hal Ashby's 1971 film soundtrack of\" Harold and Maude\". Most of the tunes used for the movie appear on Stevens's next albums,\" Mona Bone Jakon\" and\" Tea for the Tillerman\", with the exception of two songs which were not released until the release of the album in 1984,\" If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" and\" Do n't Be Shy\".

The sixth of eight children born to a poor family in Tryon, North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well-received audition, which she attributed to racial discrimination. In 2003, just days before her death, the Institute awarded her an honorary degree. To make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to \"Nina Simone\" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play \"the devil's music\" or so-called \"cocktail piano\". She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist.

Henreid had previously appeared in some British- American co-productions made in England and had starred on Broadway in the play\" Flight to the West\" as Paul von Hernreid. When he was signed with RKO in 1942, the studio changed his surname, dropping the\" von\" and changing his last name to\" Henreid\", the name he used for the rest of his film career. Cregar was borrowed from 20th- Century Fox. Alan Ladd, who played one of the downed airmen, would soon become a star later that year.

Molchan( June 5, 1922 \u2013 April 12, 2005) was an American spokesperson, most famous for his work as Little Oscar for the Oscar Mayer meat company. Molchan grew up in the Gary, Indiana area; as a young boy, he received hormone treatments to try to make him grow taller. His lack of height was a concern to him; a local theater manager who sympathized with his worries managed to contact Meinhardt Raabe, who was\" Little Oscar\", the spokesman for the Oscar Mayer company. Raabe met with Molchan and assured him that if he continued his education, he would have a bright future ahead. Molchan took his advice, earning both an accounting degree from his local junior college and a degree in communications from Chicago's Columbia College. He went to work as a bookkeeper for Pepsi- Cola, staying with the job until 1951. Oscar Mayer had plans to expand its promotion of the\" Little Oscar\" character. The company decided to put more than one Wienermobile on the road to travel the United States, which meant they were in need of more spokespersons to do the same work Raabe did. Raabe contacted Molchan and suggested he apply for one of the positions. Molchan was hired and was based in Chicago; the other additional Wienermobiles were based in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Madison, Wisconsin, the company's home. He traveled the United States in his Wienermobile for 20 years, making appearances at parades, shopping centers and grocery stores. At each appearance, Molchan gave away plastic\" wiener whistles\", which were shaped like a hot dog with the company's logo on them that whistled the Oscar Mayer tune when blown. During many of these cross-country trips, he was accompanied by Stan and Denise Stanley, both of whom were responsible for various roles, ranging from driving the Wienermobile to distributing toys. As a result of the Stanleys' efforts during the early 1980s, they were recognized during both the 1982 and 1983 year- end reports. After the company phased out the Wienermobiles, Molchan remained on the job for them. He relocated to Orlando, Florida for a job as\" Little Oscar\" in the Oscar Mayer restaurant at Disney World in the mid 1970s. Molchan worked at Disney for 16 years, retiring in 1987. Upon his retirement, Oscar Mayer also retired the\" Little Oscar\" character that began with Meinhardt Raabe in 1936. After retirement, Molchan did some part- time character work, but was always recognized as\" Little Oscar\". He eventually moved back to Indiana to be near family members. When Molchan was buried in a Merrillville, Indiana cemetery on April 16, 2005, Oscar Mayer sent one of the Wienermobiles to the cemetery, where it was parked near his gravesite during the ceremonies. Molchan's mourners also sang\" Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener\", and followed it with wiener whistle toots of tribute.\n\nWhich film has the director who is older, The Girl King or Happy As The Grass Was Green?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Like its predecessors, it is based on a BBC Television serial\" Quatermass and the Pit\", written by Nigel Kneale. It was directed by Roy Ward Baker and stars Andrew Keir in the title role as Professor Bernard Quatermass, replacing Brian Donlevy who played the role in the two earlier films. James Donald, Barbara Shelley and Julian Glover appear in co-starring roles. The storyline, which is largely faithful to the original television production, centres on the discovery of a mysterious object buried at the site of an extension to the London Underground. Also uncovered nearby are the remains of early human ancestors more than five million years old. Realising that the object is in fact an ancient Martian spacecraft, Quatermass deduces that the aliens have influenced human evolution and the development of human intelligence. The spacecraft has an intelligence of its own, and once uncovered begins to exert a malign influence, resurrecting Martian memories and instincts buried deep within the human psyche. Nigel Kneale wrote the first draft of the screenplay in 1961, but difficulties in attracting interest from American co-financiers meant the film did not go into production until 1967. The director, Roy Ward Baker, was chosen because of his experience with technically demanding productions such as\" A Night to Remember\"; this was the first of six films that he directed for Hammer. Andrew Keir, playing Quatermass, found making the film an unhappy experience, believing Baker had wanted Kenneth More to play the role. Owing to a lack of space, the film was shot at the MGM studios in Elstree, Borehamwood, rather than Hammer's usual home at the time, which was the Associated British Studios, also in Elstree. The film opened in November 1967 to favourable reviews and remains generally well regarded.\n\nNH4\nNH4 or NH 4 or NH- 4 may refer to:\n\nRequiem for a Gunfighter\nRequiem for a Gunfighter is a 1965 American western film, the last picture directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet, produced by Alex Gordon, and starring Rod Cameron, Stephen McNally, Mike Mazurki, Dick Jones, and Olive Sturgess.

Social systems such as religion, language and ethnic traditions can have a powerful impact on realization of sexual orientation. Influences of culture may complicate the process of measuring sexual orientation. The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-class, well-educated samples, however there are pockets of research that document various other cultural groups, although these are frequently limited in diversity of gender and sexual orientation of the subjects. Integration of sexual orientation with sociocultural identity may be a challenge for LGBT individuals. Individuals may or may not consider their sexual orientation to define their sexual identity, as they may experience various degrees of fluidity of sexuality, or may simply identify more strongly with another aspect of their identity such as family role. American culture puts a great emphasis on individual attributes, and views the self as unchangeable and constant. In contrast, East Asian cultures put a great emphasis on a person's social role within social hierarchies, and view the self as fluid and malleable. These differing cultural perspectives have many implications on cognitions of the self, including perception of sexual orientation.\n\n2005 World Figure Skating Championships\nThe 2005 World Figure Skating Championships were held at the Luzhniki Sports Palace in Moscow, Russia from March 14 to 20.

The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy.\n\nCrazy Heart\nCrazy Heart is a 2009 American drama film, written and directed by Scott Cooper and based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Thomas Cobb.

The building was the home of the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes. It is not to be confused with other houses associated with Cervantes, the birthplace in Alcala de Henares and the museum in Esquivias. Valladolid is where the Spanish Court was briefly, from 1601 to 1606, the last time it left Madrid. ( See.) Cervantes' House was part of the wave of construction that filled the demand created by the sudden growth in population the Corte's relocation provoked. That is to say, it was a new or nearly- new house. There is good information on Cervantes' Valladolid house, where he was living in 1605. By chance, a prominent nobleman was murdered in the street in front of Cervantes' house. The body of the dying man was taken to the lower floor of the house Cervantes lived in, where he expired. The ensuing investigation involved depositions from everyone in the house at the time. From this documentation, thoroughly studied by, we know that instead of occupying the three houses joined together to create the museum, his mother lived in one room and the rest of his household in another, above a tabern on the ground floor. Only women were living with him: his wife Catalina, his very religious(\" beata\") sister Magdalena, a seamstress for wealthy gentlemen, his sister Andrea, also a seamstress, her illegitimate daughter Costanza, Cervantes' illegitimate daughter Isabel, and a maid named Mar\u00eda. It is well documented in the testimony that prostitution was taking place in the house, but the identity of the prostitutes was never clarified. There were suspicions that among them may have been some of the women in Cervantes' household. The building has been designated with the heritage listing Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural( Property of Cultural Value), and has been protected since 9 June 1958.\n\nSophie Morgan\nSophie Morgan( born 1985), is a British television presenter and former reality television contestant.

During the first period, he did not rule, and the entire government was in the hands of his mother, Empress Wu Zetian. In the second period, most of the government was in the hands of his beloved wife Empress Wei). Emperor Zhongzong was the son of Emperor Gaozong of Tang and Empress Wu( later known as Wu Zetian). He succeeded his father in 684. His mother, however, deposed him less than two months later in favor of his younger brother Emperor Ruizong. The former emperor, demoted to a princely rank, was sent in exile in the provinces and placed under house arrest. Six years later, Emperor Ruizong in turn relinquished the throne to his mother and Empress Dowager Wu officially proclaimed herself empress regnant, while Emperor Ruizong was made crown prince. By 698 the court was caught in the middle of a bitter power struggle. In an attempt to secure her prominence, Empress Wu liberated the former emperor from his 14 years of seclusion and recalled him to the capital in April 698. He was reinstated as crown prince in October 698, taking the place of his brother. On 20 February 705, a palace coup deposed Wu Zetian and Emperor Zhongzong was restored as emperor three days later. Emperor Zhongzong reigned for five years but was a rather weak and easily influenced ruler. Real power was in the hands of his empress consort, Empress Wei and her lover Wu Sansi( Wu Zetian's nephew). In 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei, who then installed his son, Li Chongmao, as Emperor Shang. Empress Wei, who had failed to install her daughter Li Guo'er, the Princess Anle, as heir to Emperor Zhongzong, thought that Li Chongmao, born of Zhongzong and a concubine and who was only 16 years old, would be easy to control and allow her to preserve her power.

The Act of Supremacy of 1534 confirmed the King's status as having supremacy over the church and required the nobility to swear an oath recognising Henry's supremacy. By 1536, Henry had broken with Rome, seized the church's assets in England and declared the Church of England as the established church with himself as its head. Henry's daughter, Queen Mary I, a staunch Catholic, attempted to restore the English church's allegiance to the Pope and repealed the Act of Supremacy in 1555. Her half - sister, the Protestant Elizabeth I, took the throne in 1558 and the next year, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy of 1559 that restored the original act. The new Oath of Supremacy that nobles were required to swear gave the Queen's title as Supreme Governor of the church rather than Supreme Head, to avoid the charge that the monarchy was claiming divinity or usurping Christ, whom the Bible explicitly identifies as Head of the Church.\n\nJapan Yin Thwe\nJapan Yin Thwe  is a 1935 Burmese film directed by Nyi Pu.

The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Mitchum's only nomination for Best Supporting Actor. This was the film that established him as one of the world's biggest movie stars. The story is a tribute to the American infantryman(\" G.I. Joe\") during World War II, told through the eyes of Pulitzer Prize- winning war correspondent Ernie Pyle, with dialogue and narration lifted from Pyle's columns. The film concentrates on one company,(\" C Company, 18th Infantry\"), that Pyle accompanies into combat in Tunisia and Italy. The friendships that grow out of his coverage led Pyle to relate the misery and sacrifice inherent in their plight and their heroic endurance of it. Although the company has the designation of an actual unit, that unit did not participate in the combat in Italy that makes up the preponderance of the film, and actually stands in for the units of the 34th and 36th Infantry Divisions that Pyle did cover in Italy. Although filmed with the cooperation of Pyle, the film premiered two months to the day after he was killed in action on Ie Shima during the invasion of Okinawa.

Others argue that the ESA may encourage preemptive habitat destruction by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species; known colloquially as \"Shoot, Shovel and Shut-Up.\" One example of such perverse incentives is the case of a forest owner who, in response to ESA listing of the red-cockaded woodpecker, increased harvesting and shortened the age at which he harvests his trees to ensure that they do not become old enough to become suitable habitat.

A prolific author, he had his first book, a biography of Khama III, accepted for publication while still in high school at Lovedale. This book was later quashed by the Bechuanaland Protectorate authorities and was not published. He was banished from the Bangwato Reserve in 1937 after Tshekedi Khama, the Bangwato regent accused Raditladi of adultery with his wife as well as for conspiring to bewitch him. After that Raditladi served as a colonial service clerk and quickly became the highest ranking Motswana in the Protectorate. Following his experiences with Tshekedi, Raditladi wrote his historical drama Motswasele II, his most famous work. The major theme of this work is with royal despotism and the perverted results of such tyranny. In 1944 the Batawana Kgosi Moremi III asked the British to appoint Raditladi as the head of the Tsetse Fly Control agency in Ngamiland. As such he became the first Motswana to head a government department. Two years later, Moremi appointed him Tribal Secretary. This appointment occurred just before Moremi's death, following which the chief was succeeded by his wife, the regent EP Moremi. Raditladi and the Regent, both foreign- born, exercised tight control over Ngamiland and quickly aroused resentment. Their clandestine love affair also become public knowledge. In late 1950 the Regent was forced to abort Raditladi's child, an event that led Raditladi's opponents to drive him out of Ngamiland at gunpoint. During the 1940s Raditladi was instrumental in establishing the sport of soccer in Botswana, and was behind the formation of leagues in both the northern and southern parts of the country. In 1958 after his return to Serowe Raditladi founded the Bechuanaland Protectorate Federal Party.

The intent was to flatten the yield curve in order to promote capital inflows and strengthen the dollar. The Fed utilized open market operations to shorten the maturity of public debt in the open market. It performs the 'twist' by selling some of the short term debt (with three years or less to maturity) it purchased as part of the quantitative easing policy back into the market and using the money received from this to buy longer term government debt. Although this action was marginally successful in reducing the spread between long - term maturities and short - term maturities, Vincent Reinhart and others have suggested it did not continue for a sufficient period of time to be effective. Despite being considered a failure since a 1966 near - term analysis by Franco Modigliani and Richard Sutch, the action has subsequently been reexamined and in a 2011 paper economist Eric Swanson of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has suggested that ``Operation Twist ''was more effective than originally thought. Swanson suggested similar action as an alternative to quantitative easing by central banks; the FOMC did in fact take an analogous action in 2011.\n\nWho is the paternal grandmother of John Iii, Duke Of Cleves?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He set the foundations for the future Angkorian kings to follow. The king's  first act was to perform a public service for his subjects by building an irrigation network for the rice fields. The goal was usually achieved by constructing a large reservoir to retain water during the monsoon season and then release it during the dry season through a network of canals and channels. And in Hindu mythology the reservoir also represents an ocean and the temple-mountain represents Mount Meru, the home of the gods. The king and his Brahman advisors performed many rituals throughout the year to reinforce this belief; for example, the ritual of rain-making performed before the rice planting season. Immediately, after Indravarman I acceded, he declared in his Pr\u00e1\u1e25 K\u00f4 inscription: \"In five days from today I shall begin digging, etc.\" Dig he did with a reservoir of an immense size: the Indrat\u0101\u1e6daka was the biggest reservoir ever built before his time being 3.8 kilometres (2.4 mi) long by 800 metres (2,600 ft) wide.

Little is known of the precise basis for his successful claim to the throne since he was not a son of Osorkon II and Shoshenq's parentage and family ties are unknown. From Shoshenq III's eighth regnal year, his reign was marked by the loss of Egypt's political unity, with the appearance of Pedubast I at Thebes. Henceforth, the kings of the 22nd Dynasty only controlled Lower Egypt. The Theban High Priest Osorkon B( the future Osorkon III) did date his activities at Thebes and( Upper Egypt) to Shoshenq III's reign, but this was solely for administrative reasons since Osorkon did not declare himself king after the death of his father, Takelot II.

He wrote mostly in Sicilian and likewise, his theatrical works were mostly in Sicilian. He founded a theatre company in Catania in the early part of the 20th century. In the latter stages of his life he had some success as a film director. From 1889 to 1904 he published a weekly magazine called\" D' Artagnan\". It represents one of the very few periodicals ever to have been published in Sicilian to enjoy prolonged success. Its content included art, literature, theatre and politics, or more accurately, political satire. In terms of the Sicilian language, Martoglio is an important figure in the establishment of Sicilian as an acceptable literary language. His magazine also played a role in discovering such leading Italian illustrators as Giovanni Grasso and Angelo Musco. His theatre company debuted the works of renowned dramatists such as Pier Maria Rosso di San Secondo and the Nobel prize winner, Luigi Pirandello. He founded the\" Compagnia drammatica siciliana\" in 1903. From 1913 to 1915 he started directing movies. He enjoyed some success with\" Teresa Raquin\" and\" Sperduti nel buio\". In 1919 he founded the\" Compagnia Drammatica del Teatro Mediterraneo\". Martoglio \u2019s films are among a small core of films that constitute the realismo movement, which later inspired neorealism. In the 1930s, film critic and teacher Umberto Barbaro exalted Sperduti nel buio in his essays, and showed it in his classes at Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome. These classes were attended by Roberto Rossellini and Luchino Visconti, who would become instrumental in defining the neorealism film movement after the Second World War. His best known theatrical works, which enjoyed success throughout Italy, include\" Nica\"( from 1903),\" L\u2019aria del Continente\"( from 1915), and\" San Giuvanni Decollato\" from 1908.

In addition to the title, \"Bed and Sofa\" it was also released outside of the Soviet Union under the alternate titles of \"Three in a CellarOld Dovecots\", and \"Cellars of Moscow\". The film gets its Russian title from the street on which the main characters live, Third Meshchanskaia Street. Directed by Abram Room and written by Room and Viktor Shklovsky, the film starred Nikolai Batalov as the husband, Kolia, Lyudmila Semyonova as the wife, Liuda, and Vladimir Fogel as the friend, Volodia. Billed as a satire and comedy, \"Bed and Sofa\" nonetheless portrayed the realities of the Moscow working poor, while also dealing with starkly sexual situations, such as polygamy and abortion. It was originally banned in both the United States and Europe due to those stark sexual situations. The screenplay was supposedly based on the true love story of the acclaimed Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky who lived with his \"muse\" Lilya Brik and her husband Osip Brik for some years. The characters themselves also resembled the trio, with Vladimir Fogel as Mayakovsky, Lyudmila Semyonova as Lilya and Nikolai Batalov as Osip Brik. The parallels were so obvious that some critics and associates accused Viktor Shklovsky of indelicacy and gossiping. Shklovsky himself never openly admitted it, yet in his diaries he mentions that during the work on the screenplay they \u00abwere living next to Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik\u00bb, which is an obvious hint. While movies made in the USSR would soon be regulated to the ideals of Soviet realism, some films at this time were able to present starker themes. Even so, \"Bed and Sofa\" was controversial at the time of release in the Soviet Union, due to its focus on human relationships, while the state and the party are almost completely disregarded. In fact, at one point Kolya even declines to go to a Party meeting. In addition, the film's resolution is ambiguous and comes about without any input from the collective.

Woodruff has been widely reported as the Central Intelligence Agency station chief involved in training the bodyguards of the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze and an \u00e9lite Omega Special Task Force. He was shot in the head and killed in 1993 on a mountain road in the sensitive border area with Ossetia whilst on a\" private trip\" in a vehicle driven by the Georgian head of security Elgar Gogoladze. This program had been initiated under the cover of USAID after a state visit to Georgia in 1992 by the American foreign secretary James Baker III immediately after Eduard Shevardnadze had been installed as head of state in the follow- up of a bloody\" coup d'etat\" supported by foreign powers against the democratically elected president of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who died under suspicious circumstances a year later.

In 2013, Georgian Minister of Justice Tea Tsulukiani stated that\"[ t] he case has not been properly investigated\".

He was Minister of National Defense from 1944 to 1951, and the second democratically elected President of Guatemala from 1951 to 1954. He was a major figure in the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution, which represented some of the few years of representative democracy in Guatemalan history. The landmark program of agrarian reform \u00c1rbenz enacted as president was very influential across Latin America. \u00c1rbenz was born in 1913 to a wealthy family, son of a Swiss German father and a Guatemalan mother. He graduated with high honors from a military academy in 1935, and served in the army until 1944, quickly rising through the ranks. During this period, he witnessed the violent repression of agrarian laborers by the United States-backed dictator Jorge Ubico, and was personally required to escort chain-gangs of prisoners, an experience that contributed to his progressive views. In 1938 he met and married Mar\u00eda Vilanova, who was a great ideological influence on him, as was Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fortuny, a Guatemalan communist. In October 1944 several civilian groups and progressive military factions led by \u00c1rbenz and Francisco Arana rebelled against Ubico's repressive policies. In the elections that followed, Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo was elected president, and began a highly popular program of social reform. \u00c1rbenz was appointed Minister of Defense, and played a crucial role in putting down a military coup in 1949. After the death of Arana, \u00c1rbenz contested the presidential elections that were held in 1950 and without significant opposition defeated Miguel Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes, his nearest challenger, by a margin of over 50%. He took office on March 15, 1951, and continued the social reform policies of his predecessor. These reforms included an expanded right to vote, the ability of workers to organize, legitimizing political parties, and allowing public debate. The centerpiece of his policy was an agrarian reform law under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. His policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was also concerned by the presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, and \u00c1rbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. \u00c1rbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an apology for \u00c1rbenz's overthrow.\n\nMaster of International Affairs\nThe Master of International Affairs( MIA), also known as the Master of Global Affairs( MGA), is a master's degree awarded by schools of international affairs.\n\nBarbara Cartland\nDame Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland, (9 July 1901 \u2013 21 May 2000) was an English novelist who wrote romance novels, one of the best-selling authors as well as one of the most prolific and commercially successful worldwide of the 20th century.

It is by far the most active region the planet, as it is home to its strongest retrograde jet stream.

A period of weeks or months following the belt's disappearance, a white spot forms and erupts dark brownish material which is stretched into a new belt by Jupiter's winds.

Arnold was the grandson of Reinald's sister, Johanna. Although the Emperor Sigismund had invested the Duke of Berg with the duchy of Gelders, Arnold retained the confidence of the Estates by enlarging their privileges, and enjoyed the support of Duke Philip of Burgundy. Arnold was betrothed, and afterwards united in marriage to Catherine of Cleves, a niece of Philip of Burgundy. Subsequently, however, Duke Arnold fell out with his ally as to the succession to the see of Utrecht, whereupon Philip joined with the four chief towns of Guelders in the successful attempt of Arnold's son Adolf to substitute his own for his father's authority. Arnold gave up his claim on J\u0171lich only after his defeat in 1444 by Gerhard VII, Duke of J\u00fclich-Berg. When Charles the Bold became Duke of Burgundy in 1467, after rejecting a compromise, Adolph was thrown into prison.

Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III, Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye. Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects; in the late 1860s, he approached Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, a plan to build Progress or Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia, a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient Egyptian female fellah or peasant, robed and holding a torch aloft, at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said. Sketches and models were made of the proposed work, though it was never erected. There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal, the Colossus of Rhodes: an ancient bronze statue of the Greek god of the sun, Helios. This statue is believed to have been over 100 feet (30 m) high, and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships.\n\nWho is Frederick Of Luxembourg's paternal grandfather?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Lemoine was born in Rouen. He declined to follow his father's precedent in becoming a notary, and instead began study at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Rouen. Having moved to Paris by 1772, he studied under Jean-Jacques Lagren\u00e9e (1737\u20131821) and Maurice-Quentin de la Tour (1704\u20131788). He was attracted to Parisian theater and music, and early in his career often portrayed actors, singers, and musicians, using pastels and chalk. He also worked in oil, watercolor, and porcelain. In the late 1770s or early 1780s, he may have sketched for fashion plates. In 1783, Lemoine married the artist Agathe-Fran\u00e7oise Bonvallet. He began his work as a miniaturist in the mid-1780s. His early miniatures are influenced by the \"free and painterly technique\" of Pierre-Adolphe Hall. In 1785, he painted Louise Beno\u00eet Zamor, the page of Madame du Barry and later revolutionary. The portrait is one piece of evidence for Zamor's African origin. Lemoine invented a perspective easel for use in landscape painting, and another device to help create likenesses in portraiture. He also collected texts on geometry and perspective in relation to design and painting. Lemoine's wife died in 1794, and he returned to Rouen, where he was appointed professor of drawing at the \u00c9cole de Marine in 1799. After 1798, he produced few works, but kept a pied-\u00e0-terre in Paris and continued to exhibit at the Salons through 1817. He died at his home in Paris, and bequeathed his manuscript collection to the state.

Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.\n\nSputnik 2\nSputnik 2 (, , \"Satellite 2\"), or Prosteyshiy Sputnik 2 (PS-2, , \"Elementary Satellite 2\") was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit, on 3 November 1957, and the first to carry a living animal, a Soviet space dog named Laika.

He was born in Carona, Ticino, and apprenticed under his father Guiniforte Solari, himself an architect and sculptor. In 1476, he was hired to continue the construction of the Duomo di Milano. Later on, he was in charge of several construction projects in Milan. In 1484 he sculpted a tomb in the Cathedral of Alessandria. In 1487, he was invited to Russia by Ivan III to construct the walls and towers of the Moscow Kremlin. Within the next two years, Solari built most of the walls (excluding the western wall built by his successor Aleviz) and towers of the Kremlin, including the Borovitskaya, Konstantino-Eleninskaya, Spasskaya, Nikolskaya, and Corner Arsenalnaya towers. Engineering methods, technique and architectural forms, used by Solari, were reminiscent of the fortifications of Northern Italy. On top of the Spasskie Gates there was inscribed the following inscription: IOANNES VASILII DEI GRATIA MAGNUS DUX VOLODIMERIAE, MOSCOVIAE, NOVOGARDIAE, TFERIAE, PLESCOVIAE, VETICIAE, ONGARIAE, PERMIAE, BUOLGARIAE ET ALIAS TOTIUSQ(UE) RAXIE D(OMI)NUS, A(N)NO 30 IMPERII SUI HAS TURRES CO(N)DERE F(ECIT) ET STATUIT PETRUS ANTONIUS SOLARIUS MEDIOLANENSIS A(N)NO N(ATIVIT) A(TIS) D(OM)INI 1491 K(ALENDIS) M(ARTIIS) I(USSIT) P(ONERE).

Dawnay was the son of John Dawnay, 1st Viscount Downe, by his second wife Dorothy, daughter of William Johnson, of Wickham, Lancashire. Dawnay succeeded his father as Member of Parliament for Pontefract in 1690, a seat he held until 1695. In 1695, he also succeeded his father in the viscountcy. As this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the English House of Lords (although it did entitle him to a seat in the Irish House of Lords). He was consequently eligible for election to the English House of Commons and in 1698 he was elected Member of Parliament for Yorkshire, a seat he held until 1700. He was returned as MP for Yorkshire at a by-election in December 1707 and was re-elected MP for Yorkshire at the 1708 general election. He was elected again in 1710, 1713, and 1715 1722. Lord Downe married Mildred, daughter of William Godfrey, of Thornock, Lincolnshire, in 1685. She died in August 1725. Downe remained a widower until his death in May 1741, aged 76. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his grandson, Henry, his son the Honourable John Dawnay having predeceased him.\n\nFire alarm notification appliance\nCoding refers to the pattern or tones a notification appliance sounds in and is controlled either by the panel or by setting jumpers or DIP switches on the notification appliances. The majority of audible notification appliances installed prior to 1996 produced a steady sound for evacuation. In general, no common standard at that time mandated any particular tone, or pattern for audible fire alarm evacuation signals. While less common than a steady sound, differing signaling methods were used for the same purpose. These are named with respect to their distinctive structure and include, March Time (usually 120 pulses per minute but sometimes at 90 pulses or 20 pulses per minute, depending on the panel), Hi - Lo (two different tones that alternate), Slow - Whoop (slow rising sweep upwards in tone) among others. Today these methods are confined to applications intended to trigger a response other than evacuation alone. In 1996, the ANSI and the NFPA recommended a standard evacuation pattern to eliminate confusion. The pattern is uniform without regard to the sound used. This pattern, which is also used for smoke alarms, is named the Temporal - Three alarm signal, often referred to as ``T - 3 ''(ISO 8201 and ANSI / ASA S3. 41 Temporal Pattern) and produces an interrupted four count (three half second pulses, followed by a one and one half second pause, repeated for a minimum of 180 seconds). CO (carbon monoxide) detectors are specified to use a similar pattern using four pulses of tone (often referred to as T4).\n\nSubway to the Stars\nSubway to the Stars  is a 1987 Brazilian drama film directed by Carlos Diegues.

In the Western world, males die three to four times more often by means of suicide than do females. This difference is even more pronounced in those over the age of 65, with tenfold more males than females dying by suicide. Suicide attempts and self-harm are between two and four times more frequent among females. Researchers have attributed the difference between attempted and completed suicides among the sexes to males using more lethal means to end their lives. However, separating intentional suicide attempts from non-suicidal self-harm is not currently done in the United States when gathering statistics at the national level.China has one of the highest female suicide rates in the world and is the only country where it is higher than that of men (ratio of 0.9). In the Eastern Mediterranean, suicide rates are nearly equivalent between males and females. The highest rate of female suicide is found in South Korea at 22 per 100,000, with high rates in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific generally.A number of reviews have found an increased risk of suicide among transgender, lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Among transgender persons rates of attempted suicide are about 40% compared to a general population rate of 5%.

He was the scion of a hereditary feudal noble line with roots in Yunnan province. \u0110\u00e8o V\u0103n Long generated much revenue for the Federation by acting as a middleman in the opium traffic between the Tai Federation and the French. He compelled the Hmong of the Federation to sell to him at below-market prices, thus making enormous profit from his sales to the French. This made him rich, but severed his relationship with the Hmong of the Federation, who supported the Viet Minh during the First Indochina War.

He went first to Laos, then later immigrated to France as a refugee, but died shortly thereafter. His sons had died in battle leading White Tai partisans against the Viet Minh so in France leadership of the clan line was succeeded by his daughter Deo Nang Toi (d.2008).\n\nBian, Hamadan\nBian( also Romanized as B\u012b\u0101n and Bay\u0101n) is a village in Gamasiyab Rural District, in the Central District of Nahavand County, Hamadan Province, Iran.

Coming back to Uppsala, he completed his doctoral degree and was appointed lecturer in physics at the new university college in Stockholm (now Stockholm University) in 1885. After a few years working there, he returned to Uppsala in 1891 and received the professorship of Physics in 1896. He focused his research work on investigating the radiation of heat from the sun, terrestrial nocturnal emission and its absorption by the Earth's atmosphere, and to that end devised various delicate methods and instruments, including his electric compensation pyrheliometer, invented in 1893, apparatus for obtaining a photographic representation of the infra-red spectrum (1895) and pyrgeometer ( abt. 1905). In 1900, Herr J. Koch, laboratory assistant to Knut \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, did not observe any appreciable change in the absorption of infrared radiation by decreasing the concentration of CO2 up to a third of the initial amount. This result, in addition to the observation made a couple of years before that the superposition of the water vapour absorption bands, more abundant in the atmosphere, over those of CO, convinced some geologists for a time that calculations by Svante Arrhenius for CO2 warming were wrong; though subsequent work in following decades eventually vindicated Arrhenius. The experiment, however, was careless seen from the current perspective with erroneous result but of a historical significance in the development of the theory of the greenhouse effect amplified by CO.
