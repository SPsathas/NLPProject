5,"Georges de la Trémoille( c. 1382 – 6 May 1446) was Count de Guînes from 1398 to 1446 and Grand Chamberlain of France to King Charles VII of France. He sought reconciliation between Philip, Duke of Burgundy and Charles VII during their estrangement in the latter part of the Hundred Years' War. De la Trémoille was a political opponent of Arthur de Richemont within the French court. Most historians take a poor view of his career, assessing that he placed personal advancement before the public interest, though the traditional historical interpretation of the Grand Chamberlain as Jeanne d' Arc's opponent has been revised. La Trémoille was captured at Agincourt in 1415. He regained his freedom shortly afterward and dedicated the rest of his career to court life and diplomacy. He made an advantageous marriage to Joan II of Auvergne( 1378 – 1424), Countess of Auvergne and Boulogne( 1404 – 1424). De la Trémoille served the Burgundian court for several years, then joined the Armagnac court of Charles VII. La Trémoille became a royal favourite in 1427. He gained the title of Grand Chamberlain and was instrumental in Constable de Richemont's expulsion from the court that same year. Following Joan of Arc's successful campaign to Rheims for the coronation of Charles VII, la Trémoille delayed a march on Paris with fruitless peace negotiations. He may have been responsible for the lack of royal support that doomed her military actions thereafter. The historical consensus is that personal jealousies led him to undermine France's two best military commanders during a low point in the war. In September 1432 he paid for Rodrigo de Villandrando and his routiers to hold Les Ponts- de- Cé against the assaults of Jean de Bueil. That year de Richemont returned to court and imprisoned la Trémoille the following year. Charles VII did not intervene. His daughter Louise de la Trémoille( 1432 – 10 April 1474), Dame de Boussac, married Bertrand VI of Auvergne and had two children: He also had descents by his two mistresses; by Marie Guypaude, a daughter Marguerite( x and a son Jean the bastard of La Tremoïlle,( legitimated and ennobled in 1445), a large number of descendants); and by Marie La Championne, Jacques, the other bastard of La Tremoïlle, legitimized in 1466.

Louis Charles Marie de La Trémoille( 28 March 1863 –17 June 1921), 10th Duke of Thouars, 16th Count of Laval was a French nobleman and the son of Louis Charles de La Trémoille and his wife Marguerite Églé Jeanne Caroline Duchâtel( daughter of Count Charles Marie Tanneguy Duchâtel, Count Duchâtel and his wife Rosalie( Eglé) Paulée) La Trémoille was a deputy for Gironde from 1906 to 1919, and mayor of Margaux from 1904 to 1919.

6,"tefan I. Neniescu (October 8, 1897–October 1979) was a Romanian poet and aesthetician. Born in Bucharest, his parents were the poet Ioan S. Neniescu and his wife Elena (née tefan). He attended Sapienza University of Rome from 1920, as well as the literature and philosophy department of Bucharest University. At first an assistant professor of aesthetics, he later became an associate professor at Bucharest. He served as press secretary and later economic adviser to the Romanian legation in The Hague. Neniescu's first publication was a 1915 article about William Shakespeare that appeared in Noua revist român. His first book of poetry, Denii (1919), was followed by Vraj (1923) and Ode italice (1925). His single volume of theatre was Trei mistere (1922). From 1924, he wrote for Gândirea, and was a founding member of Romania's PEN Club. He also contributed poetry and art criticism to Convorbiri LiterareIdeea europeanVremeaUniversul literarViaa RomâneascAdevrul and Arta plastic. In 1925, Neniescu published a treatise, Istoria artei ca filosofie a istoriei. He translated from Benedetto Croce (Aesthetic, 1922) and Niccolò Machiavelli (The Mandrake, 1926). Initially, Neniescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the Gândirist current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume Ani (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature.

Ioan S. Neniescu (April 11, 1854–February 23, 1901) was a Romanian poet and playwright. Born in Galai, his parents were tefan Vasiliu, a manual laborer, and his wife Elisabeta (née Zaharia). After completing the Alexandru Ioan I commercial school in his native town , he finished high school, passing the exit examination at Iai. He also audited courses at Iai University's literature faculty. Neniescu attended an officers' school, volunteered in the Romanian War of Independence and was wounded at Grivitsa. He then studied at the philosophy faculty of Berlin University, taking a doctorate in 1887 at Leipzig University with a thesis on Baruch Spinoza. He worked as a schoolteacher and inspector in Bucharest. He traveled south of the Danube, a trip that resulted in an ample ethnic and statistical study of the AromaniansDe la românii din Turcia European, 1895). He sat in the Assembly of Deputies for his native Covurlui County, and also served as prefect of Tulcea County in the Dobruja region. Neniescu's first work appeared in the Galai newspaper Gardistul civic. A member of Junimea, he published numerous poems in its organ Convorbiri Literare. He also contributed to AlbinaAmicul copiilorRevista nouRomânul literareztoarea and Ziarul presei. While in Bucharest from 1884 to 1888, he published ara nou magazine, mainly submitting articles on pedagogy, ethics and sociology. His first book was the 1880 poetry volume Flori de primvar, followed by oimii de la Rzboieni (1882) and Pui de lei (1891). Of the plays he wrote, the only one he published was Radu de la Afumai (1897). In 1896, Neniescu was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. He died in Buzu. His son tefan also became a poet.

tefan Niculescu( July 31, 1927 – January 22, 2008) was a Romanian composer. Niculescu was born in Moreni, Dâmbovita. He was credited with introducing his own brand of heterophony, a technique based on superimposing melodic material onto variations of itself in order to create textures that are propelled by thematic energy as well as by the more common textural factors of density and levels of activity. This creative approach bears similarities with György Ligeti's micropolyphony, but important aesthetic and stylistic differences set them apart. Niculescu's work as a teacher made him a mentor to a whole generation of younger Romanian composers, among them Dan Dediu. Niculescu's work Ison II for wind and percussion permutates simultaneous segments of a diatonic melody producing a reverberating complexity of sound which is held together by a strong sense of modal clarity.  Opus Dacicum for orchestra applies similar textural explorations but with a stronger sense of harmonic movement, often with a Wagnerian lushness that lends this music a sensuous appeal a world apart from Ligeti's cluster- oriented sonorities. Among his honors are many awards from the Romanian Academy and The Society of Romanian Composers. He also received awards from the Académie des Beaux- Arts in Paris( 1972), the International Record Critics Award( 1985), and the Herder Prize in Vienna( 1994). In the 1970s he contributed to the popularization of modern music by organizing public listenings in Bucharest together with erban Stnciulescu.

9,"Antiochus( 221 BC – 193 BC) was a Seleucid prince, first- born child to the Seleucid monarchs Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III, and his father's first heir.

Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina (c. 151-after 165) was the eldest child of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and his wife, Faustina the Younger. Her younger sister was Lucilla and her younger brother was Commodus. Her maternal grandparents were Antoninus Pius and Faustina the Elder, while her paternal grandparents were Domitia Lucilla and praetor Marcus Annius Verus. She was born and raised in Rome. The parents of Faustina betrothed her to Gnaeus Claudius Severus, whom she later married after 159. Gnaeus Claudius Severus was a Roman Senator of Pontian Greek descent that came from Pompeiopolis, a city in the Roman province of Galatia. After Faustina married Claudius Severus, they settled in Pompeiopolis. Faustina bore Claudius Severus a son, Tiberius Claudius Severus Proculus, who served as consul in 200.

Antiochus X Eusebes Philopator (–92 or 88 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as the King of Syria between 95 BC and 92 BC or 89/88 BC (224 SE (Seleucid year)). He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII. The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians. Numismatic evidence shows that AntiochusX was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital in SE (88/87 BC).

Two for the Road is a 1967 British romantic comedy-drama film directed by Stanley Donen and starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney. Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period. Raphael received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, Hepburn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Henry Mancini received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score. The film's theme song, Two for the Road, was composed by Mancini, who wrote many notable theme songs for films, including Moon River for Breakfast at Tiffany's. He considered Two for the Road his favourite of all the songs he wrote. Cars featured in the film, being driven by the couple or ridden in by them, include a white Mercedes-Benz 230SL roadster, an MG TD, a Triumph Herald, an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint coupé, VW Microbus, and a Ford Country Squire; the cars are often used to re-establish the time period after a jump.

Iceland, though on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and nearer to Greenland (North America) than mainland Europe, is generally included in Europe for cultural reasons and because it is over twice as close to mainland Europe than to mainland North America. There is ongoing debate on where the geographical centre of Europe falls.

It shares borders of 6,846 kilometres (4,254 mi) with Russia, 2,203 kilometres (1,369 mi) with Uzbekistan, 1,533 kilometres (953 mi) with China, 1,051 kilometres (653 mi) with Kyrgyzstan, and 379 kilometres (235 mi) with Turkmenistan. Major cities include Nur-Sultan, Almaty, Karagandy, Shymkent, Atyrau, and Oskemen. It lies between latitudes 40° and 56° N, and longitudes 46° and 88° E. While located primarily in Asia, a small portion of Kazakhstan is also located west of the Urals in Eastern Europe.Kazakhstan's terrain extends west to east from the Caspian Sea to the Altay Mountains and north to south from the plains of Western Siberia to the oases and deserts of Central Asia. The Kazakh Steppe (plain), with an area of around 804,500 square kilometres (310,600 sq mi), occupies one-third of the country and is the world's largest dry steppe region. The steppe is characterised by large areas of grasslands and sandy regions. Major seas, lakes and rivers include the Aral Sea, Lake Balkhash and Lake Zaysan, the Charyn River and gorge and the Ili, Irtysh, Ishim, Ural and Syr Darya rivers.

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

A Legal Matter is a song written by Pete Townshend and recorded by the British rock band the Who for their debut album My Generation. It was recorded on 12 October 1965 at IBC Studios, and released as the B-side to  The Kids Are Alright in the U.S. The single was released by Shel Talmy without the permission of the Who and reached number 32. This was an attempt to sabotage the release of the band's chosen single Substitute which reached number 5, as a result of a legal dispute between Talmy and the band at the time. The subject of the song is breach of promise and it marks the first time Townshend sang lead vocals, rather than Roger Daltrey, possibly because the song was too close to home for Daltrey who was divorcing his wife at the time. Who biographer John Atkins describes Townshend's voice on the song as being higher and less abrasive than Daltrey's. But Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh thinks that although the vocal has some charm, it does not suggest that Townshend's voice would be good enough to be the band's full-time lead singer. Author Mike Segretto describes the vocal as a noncommercial adenoidal croon. According to Allmusic critic Stewart Mason, adenoidal whine actually makes the singer sound like he's sneaking out in the dead of night, scared to death that his wife's going to catch him. Atkins describes the two note guitar figure used in the introduction to the song as being memorable and catchy. He states that the song incorporates a short, jolting rhythm similar to that on their more famous song My Generation. Steve Grantley and Alan G. Parker state that the band sound like they have been let off the leash and really let rip to create another early classic.  Segretto describes the melody as being excellent. Nicky Hopkins joins the band on piano, and Segretto claims that his hyper piano runs contribute much amphetamine fuel to the song. Atkins also notes the ironic humour of the song. Mason also finds the song funny. Segretto points out that the lyrics are surprisingly misogynistic coming from Townshend, but that is softened by the playful tone and cute lines like 'Just wanna keep on doing all the dirty little things I do. According to Townshend the song is about a guy on the run from a chick about to pin him down for breach of contract. What this song was screaming from behind lines like 'It's a legal matter, baby, marrying's no fun / It's a legal matter , baby, you got me on the run' was,  I'm lonely, I'm hungry, the bed needs making.' I wanted a maid, I suppose.  Marsh suggests that the protagonist really doesn't want to marry because he's terrified of discovering who he really is (boring, middle-class and conventional.) Several commentators noted an influence from the Rolling Stones on this song, particularly their song The Last Time.  For example, Segretto states A Legal Matter has a nagging, droning riff that may share DNA with 'The Last Time.' Mason states that the song proves conclusively that Pete Townshend was working on a different plane than just about every other songwriter in London in 1965.

Both the screenplay and the successful stage play on which it was based were written by English playwright Frederick Knott. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television, before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October. Originally intended to be shown in dual- strip polarized 3- D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2- D due to the loss of interest in the 3- D process( the projection of which was difficult and error- prone) by the time of its release.

Model for Murder is a 1959 British crime film directed by Terry Bishop and starring Keith Andes, Hazel Court and Jean Aubrey.

Murders in the Rue Morgue is a 1932 American pre-Code horror film, very loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story The Murders in the Rue Morgue. Bela Lugosi, one year after his performance as Dracula, portrays a lunatic scientist who abducts women and injects them with blood from his ill-tempered caged ape. Karl Freund's cinematography and Robert Florey's direction have been praised by critics and characterized as expressionistic by Leonard Maltin. Despite the film being pre-Code, violent sequences prompted Universal to cut its running time from 80 minutes to 61 minutes. This film was produced as a compensatory package for Lugosi and Florey after both were dropped from 1931's Frankenstein. Lugosi originally had been cast as Dr. Frankenstein, and the film was to be directed by Florey, who had been developing the coveted project. Lugosi subsequently was demoted to play the mute monster, however, which he claimed to have turned down. Florey was replaced as director by James Whale because producer Carl Laemmle was unsatisfied with Florey's work on the project, and he had given Whale first choice of any Universal property at the time. The box-office results for Murders in the Rue Morgue were disappointing, and Lugosi's original Universal contract for Dracula was not extended. Today, however, the film generally is well-regarded by critics and is considered a cult classic.

The King's Speech is a 2010 historical drama film directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler. Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian speech and language therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939. Seidler read about George VI's life after overcoming a stuttering condition he endured during his own youth. He started writing about the relationship between the therapist and his royal patient as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King's widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, Logue's notebooks were discovered and quotations from them were incorporated into the script. Principal photography took place in London and around Britain from November 2009 to January 2010. Hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider than normal lenses were employed to recreate the Duke of York's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off- centre framing of characters.  The King's Speech was a major box office and critical success. It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, screenplay, directing, score, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance, which resulted in his first Oscar win for Best Actor. At the 83rd Academy Awards, The King's Speech received 12 Oscar nominations, more than any other film in that year, and subsequently won four, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of £ 8 million, it earned over £ 250 million($ 400 million) internationally.

Their single Cellophane was a minor college radio hit in the band's native Seattle, getting frequent airplay on KCMU( now KEXP). The band's sound was influenced by the works of Krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, and their first album also bore some sonic resemblance to the sounds of early 1990s bands from the UK shoegaze scene. This mesh of krautrock, shoegaze, drone, space- rock, and experimental electronica helped the band forge a unique sound, which helped them stand apart from other active bands in the Seattle scene that were more grunge, metal, or indie- rock based. Their success in solidifying a unique sound however did not translate to album sales, and the band remained a relatively obscure act, with a small cult following. The band split in 1998, and Ritter and Brown recorded together as Fontanelle for a couple more years.

She is also called Busilla, but this name is a misunderstanding of the ancient Italian word pucelle meaning virgin. Coloman, King of Hungary sent his envoys to her father's court to propose marriage to her in 1096, but the Count of Sicily did not qualify the envoys illustrious enough and refused the offer. The second mission of the King of Hungary was led by Bishop Hartvik, but insisted on further negotiations. Finally, the envoys, led by Duke Álmos, the king's younger brother, accompanied Felicia to Hungary, where she was married to King Coloman around 1097. She was followed by some Sicilian courtiers as well, e.g. the ancestors of the future gens Rátót (Olivér and Rátót) who arrived to Hungary in her escort.

Encarnación Ezcurra (March 25, 1795 – October 20, 1838) was an Argentine politician, wife of Juan Manuel de Rosas. She was the daughter of Juan Ignacio Ezcurra and Teodora de Arguibel. She married Rosas on March 16, 1813. She became her husband's most faithful follower, helping him in many difficult circumstances. In 1833-1834, her husband was away from Buenos Aires leading an army in the Desert Campaign to extend Argentina's frontier. She was the driving force behind the Revolution of the Restorers, and was the president of the Mazorca, an organization which acted as a secret police. The Revolution of the Restorers unseated Juan Ramón Balcarce the governor of the Buenos Aires. The Mazorca put pressure on every government worker to vocally campaign for the return of de Rosas. This forced the provincial legislature, the Board of Representatives, which had the power to designate governors, to regard her husband as the only option to restore social order in the province. After the triumph of her husband in the Desert Campaign (1833–34), and with her success in securing the governorship for him, the people gave her the title of Heroine of the Holy Federation. It is particularly notable that at that time prejudices against women participating in politics ran high, yet Ezcurra achieved great responsibilities and a considerable following. She died unexpectedly at the age of 43. Even today historians dispute the cause of her death although many believe that she died of cardiac arrest or a similar condition. Her death, however, caused great grief among the people and the political establishment. Twenty five thousand participated in her funeral procession from el Fuerte to the Convent of San Francisco, where she was buried. That would have represented 40% of the total population living in Buenos Aires at the time. The funeral costs were paid for by the Board of Representatives, whom Rosas formally thanked on November 1, 1838.

Although it is chock full of furniture and brickabrack, two successive owners obviously left a lot of their stuff so it would take an expert antiquarian of quotidian household items to guess which belonged to the poet. The house is unoccupied and available to visit though you would need to make arrangements with the administrator.

The film is very loosely based on the 1915 adventure novel The Thirty-Nine Steps by John Buchan. It is about an everyman civilian in London, Richard Hannay, who becomes caught up in preventing an organization of spies called the 39 Steps from stealing British military secrets. After being mistakenly accused of the murder of a counter-espionage agent, Hannay goes on the run to Scotland and becomes tangled up with an attractive woman while hoping to stop the spy ring and clear his name.

The 39 Steps is a 1959 British thriller film directed by Ralph Thomas and starring Kenneth More and Taina Elg. Produced by Betty Box, it is a remake of the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock film, loosely based on the novel The Thirty-Nine Steps by John Buchan. In the film, diplomat Richard Hannay returns home to London, only to become inadvertently embroiled in the death of a British spy investigating the head of an organisation planning to sell the secret of a British ballistic missile. Hannay thus travels to Scotland to escape the police, and attempts to complete the spy's work. It is the first colour version of the Buchan tale, and, unlike the mainly studio-bound original, features extensive location shooting. Several large set pieces (such as Hannay's escape from the train on the Forth Bridge and the music hall finale) and much of the dialogue are taken from the original film. As with the Hitchcock version, the scenario was contemporary rather than the pre-Great War setting of Buchan's original.

Speedy Gonzales – noin 7 veljeksen poika( 1970) is a Finnish western comedy directed by Ere Kokkonen, and written by Kokkonen with Spede Pasanen and Vesa- Matti Loiri. The title refers to Pasanen's 1968 film Noin seitsemän veljestä, though the movie does not otherwise link to it in any way. Neither has it anything to do with the cartoon character Speedy Gonzales.

His wife, however, had had the Lennox estates granted to her for life. He was buried on 20 September 1673 at Westminster Abbey.

George Stewart (or Stuart), 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny (17 July 1618 – 23 October 1642) was a Scottish nobleman and Royalist commander in the English Civil War. He was the son of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, and his wife Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton, and the brother of James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond and 4th Duke of Lennox, and of the Royalist commander Lord Bernard Stewart. Stewart, his older brother Henry, and younger brother Ludovic were brought up at Aubigny in France as Roman Catholics under the charge of their paternal grandmother, the old Duchess-Dowager, Katherine de Balsac. Stewart's father, the Duke of Lennox, died in 1624, and Stewart became a ward of his cousin, King Charles I of England. He inherited the Lordship of Aubigny at the age of 14 on the death of his elder brother Henry in 1632. By 1633, he was a student at the Collège de Navarre, part of the University of Paris, and he did homage to Louis XIII of France for the lordship of Aubigny on 5 August 1636, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Later that year he moved to England. In 1638 he secretly married Katherine Howard, the daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth Home, without her father's consent, offending his guardian the king. The portrait of Stewart by Anthony van Dyck, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, may have been painted to mark his marriage; the Latin inscription can be translated Love is stronger than I am which may allude to his conflicting loyalties. His younger brothers Lords John and Bernard are shown in a still more famous double Van Dyck portrait in the National Gallery, London - the iconic image of Cavaliers. They were also both killed in the Civil War.George Stewart and Katherine Howard had two children: He fought with the French against the Spanish in the Battle of Montjuïc (1641). As civil war loomed in England, Stewart joined the forces of King Charles at York where he was knighted on 18 April 1642 along with his brother Bernard. He was mortally wounded in the first pitched battle of the war at Edgehill on Sunday 23 October 1642, aged 24. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The lordship of Aubigny passed to his next brother, Ludovic, on his death. His widow remarried James Levingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh and had one further child Elizabeth. They were suspected in 1648 of plotting to rescue Charles I and on the discovery of the supposed plot fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650.

He later fought in the First World War, where he was wounded, captured, and held as a Prisoner of War, and resigned from the army as a major. He became a Freemason in Lodge St. John, No. 14 (now the United Lodge of Dunkeld) at the same time as his elder brother George in 1914. In 1942, aged 62, he succeeded his elder brother John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl in the dukedom. Atholl died unmarried in May 1957, aged 77.

193,"Eiludd Powys was an early 7th-century King of Powys. One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf Sarffgadau ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.

Beli ap Eiludd was a 7th- century King of Powys. Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. It is more likely however that as the genealogies state he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf, the former being the most likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw painting the Mathrafal dynasty as being descendants of Selyf. It was also likely if Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.

Gwylog ap Beli was one of the rulers of the Kingdom of Powys during the late 7th to early 8th Century, son of Beli ap Eiludd. There is also a small possibility his mother was Heledd ferch Cyndrwyn the narrator of the Canu Heledd, being that she would have been welcomed by his father Beli after the defeat at Maes Cogwy.

Some of the music in this introduction is from the 1970 choral work Kosmogonia by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. The original film is a surrealistic reunion of Leszczyc (who has apparently become a veterinary surgeon) and some of his student colleagues. They refer to themselves by the makes of the cars they own - Leszczyc owns a Zastawa, one owns a Wartburg, the others own more upmarket models such as an Opel Rekord or the Alfa Romeo owned by the unhappily married couple. Supposedly taking speed (although it is later revealed the pills are a placebo), and carousing in the cattle truck of a freight train, the group offers various satirical sidelights on Polish society of the 1960s. The characters also reflect that the truck may have been one of those in which the former generation were transported during World War II to the Nazi death camps. The final credits show the actors as they are in 1981, with the exception of Bogumil Kobiela, who died in 1969. The film was screened out of competition at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.

235,"Hunter is a song recorded by Icelandic musician Björk for her third studio album Homogenic (1997). The lyrics explore the pressure Björk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The song was first performed at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later included with the online promotional release of Homogenic; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Björk and Mark Bell, Hunter features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission. Most music critics were enticed by Hunter, which they declared one of the highlights of the Homogenic album. The single charted poorly, peaking at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart and number 55 on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. The accompanying music video for Hunter was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Björk as she transforms into a techno-bear while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics. Björk has performed Hunter on  Later... with Jools Holland and in five of her tours, the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour.

The Hunter is a blues song first recorded by Albert King in 1967 for his landmark album Born Under a Bad Sign. It was written by Stax Records' house band, Booker T. and the MGs, and Carl Wells. Along with Born Under a Bad Sign and Crosscut SawThe Hunter is one of King's best-known and most recorded songs. In 1969, Ike and Tina Turner had hit with the tune in the R&B and Hot 100 singles charts.

236,"Walter II de Beauchamp( 1192/3 – 1236), of Elmley Castle in Worcestershire( 12 miles south- east of the City of Worcester), was hereditary Sheriff of Worcestershire.

Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester, KCB (c. 1394 – c. 18 March 1421/1422) was an English peer. The only son of William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny, he succeeded as 2nd Baron Bergavenny at the death of his father on 8 May 1411. On 27 July 1411, he married Lady Isabel le Despenser, daughter of Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester, and great-granddaughter of Edward III. They had one child, Lady Elizabeth de Beauchamp, later 3rd Baroness Bergavenny, who married Sir Edward Neville, later 1st Baron Bergavenny. He was joint Warden of the Welsh Marches in 1415, and a captain of lances and archers in Normandy in 1418. In February 1420/1, he was created Earl of Worcester. Worcester was mortally wounded on 18 March 1421/2 at the Siege of Meaux and died soon after. His body was taken back to England and he was buried on 25 April 1422 at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. His daughter inherited his estates and his barony of Bergavenny, although the castle and honour of Abergavenny were still held by her grandmother in dower.

Henry de Beauchamp, 14th Earl and 1st Duke of Warwick( 22 March 142511 June 1446) was an English nobleman. He was the son of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and Isabel le Despenser. In 1434, Henry married Cecily Neville, the eldest daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Alice Montagu, Countess of Salisbury. He became 14th Earl of Warwick on his father's death in 1439. His boyhood friendship with King Henry VI and his father's military services placed him high in the King's favour, and he was loaded with titles. In 1444, he was made premier Earl of the realm, and on 14 April 1445, was created Duke of Warwick, and around the same time, granted the Forest of Feckenham. As Duke of Warwick, he was preceded only by the Duke of Norfolk. This precedence was disputed by the Duke of Buckingham, whom it displaced. However, the issue was rendered moot by his death in June, at which time the dukedom expired for lack of heirs- male. He is said to have been crowned King of the Isle of Wight in 1444 by Henry VI, to place his playmate on a more equal standing with him, but this story is considered unhistorical. On his death, the earldom was inherited by his two- year- old daughter, Anne( 14433 June 1449), suo jure Countess of Warwick. She, however, died three years later, and there was some question regarding who, if any, of her father's sisters( or their heirs) should succeed. In the end, his full sister Anne( who was married to Richard Neville, eldest son of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, and brother to Beauchamp's widow) was declared the heir, due to the English common law principle that possession by the brother makes the sister the heir, which denies relatives of the half- blood from inheriting when full- blood relatives are available to inherit. The three half- sisters from their father's first marriage contested this decision, but to no avail.

William was the second son of Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg, and after the death of his father in 1815, was under the guardianship of King George IV of the United Kingdom. He became a Prussian major in 1823. When his brother, Charles, was deposed as ruling duke by a rebellion in 1830, William took over the government provisionally. In 1831, a family law of the House of Guelph made William the ruling duke permanently. William left most government business to his ministers, and he spent most of his time outside of his state at his possessions in Oels. While William joined the Prussian- led North German Confederation in 1866, his relationship to Prussia was strained, since Prussia refused to recognize Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, his nearest male- line relative, as his heir, because of the Duke of Cumberland's claim to the throne of Hanover. William died in 1884; he passed on his private possessions to the Duke of Cumberland. His death caused a constitutional crisis for Brunswick that lasted until the accession of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, the son of the Crown Prince of Hanover, in 1913.

Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintain their distance as the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, watching dispassionately as the youngsters inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags. In a slightly uplifting coda, Belzberg and crew return a year later to find that a police who swept off the Victoriei has dispersed the children. Some of them landed in state- funded homes, while others simply moved on to one of the many abandoned construction sites that dot the city. Belzberg steers away from any discussion of the rampant sexual exploitation of these young children or the fact that one of the biggest dangers they face are STDs, including AIDS, but the urban hell she presents is shattering enough. Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants in the world's wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate. One of the children director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu. At first, this child looked like a young man, but one later finds out that girls have to become tough and look boyish in order to survive. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta' Macarena' Rosu, who is also a girl. The nickname' Macarena' derives from the song Macarena, her favorite. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled. The film explores the lives of these children, who are shown fighting, abusing themselves, and becoming addicted to Aurolac. The filmmakers follow Mihai to his family's home in the town of Constana. A similar scene films Ana and Marian as they visit their home, which is also outside Bucharest.

What is the place of birth of the performer of song Damage (Pharoahe Monch Song)?",new york city,queens,0.47256147861480713,0.0,False
281,"Damage is a song by American hip hop artist Pharoahe Monch, released as the lead single from his fourth studio album, P.T.S.D. (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Prior to its release date, Pharoahe Monch's independent label, W.A.R. Media, published a visual trailer to YouTube on September 22, 2012. The song was officially made available for purchase worldwide on September 27, 2012, on the iTunes Music Store by W.A.R. Media in conjunction with Duck Down Music Inc.. The Lee Stone-produced song is the final piece to Pharoahe's bullet trilogy in which he anthropomorphizes a slug fired with the intent to annihilate, and tackles the issue of gun violence. The song and its provide a chilling reminder that bullets have no name.

Rape is the fourth track on Internal Affairs, the debut album of Queens rapper Pharoahe Monch. Allmusic critic Steve Huey says in his review Monch lives up to his reputation as one of hip-hop's most technically skilled MCs. Nowhere is this balancing act more evident than on Rape, a rather disquieting extended metaphor for his mastery of hip-hop (other MCs just ain't fuckin' it right Primarily, the song is a satirical response to rapper Common's classic I Used to Love H.E.R., a nostalgic song that features a feminized personification of hip-hop as a lost love that has fallen to vice. Pharoahe Monch's more graphic and violent rendition is accordingly a critique of the vapid state of contemporary mainstream hip-hop, conveyed from the perspective of a variously passionate or obsessed rapist, equally infatuated by hip-hop as a woman. As Huey points out, Rape equally is an extended metaphor for Pharoahe's technical mastery of hip-hop. Personification and extended metaphor are techniques widely employed by hip-hop lyricists. In fact this very song is developed from a theme that is found in a Pharoahe Monch verse five years earlier.  Thirteen, a song from the 1994 Organized Konfusion album , contains the following excerpt from Pharoahe's verse:

Que mon cœur lâche is a 1992 song recorded by the French singer-songwriter Mylène Farmer. The single was released on 23 November 1992 to promote Farmer's compilation album Dance Remixes.

Originally recorded as a charity single, the song deals with AIDS and caused some controversy as lyrics seem to encourage the rejection of condoms. Produced as a short film, the music video was directed by the French film director Luc Besson, and features Farmer as an angel sent to Earth by God. The song reached the top ten in France and Belgium.

Where did Henry C. Lord's father graduate from?",harvard,bowdoin college,0.18433326482772827,0.0,False
282,"He was born at Southampton, where his father Richard Mant D.D. was headmaster of the King Edward VI School. He was educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Oxford which he entered in 1793. His maternal grandfather was the scholar Joseph Bingham. He was elected a Scholar of the College in 1794, graduated B.A. in 1797, and became a Fellow of Oriel College in 1798, a position he held to 1804.

John Claude Malcolm Lowe( 21 February 1888 – 27 July 1970) was an English cricketer who played first- class cricket in 35 matches for Oxford University and Warwickshire between 1907 and 1910. He was born at Edgbaston, Birmingham, and died at Hastings, East Sussex. Lowe was the son of Sir Francis Lowe, 1st Baronet who was MP for Edgbaston from 1898 to 1929. Two of his brothers were talented lawn tennis players: Sir Francis Lowe, 2nd Baronet and Arthur Lowe. Educated at Uppingham School, where he was captain of the cricket eleven, and at Oriel College, Oxford, Lowe was a lower- order right- handed batsman and a right- arm fast- medium bowler who made the ball swerve. He took five Lancashire wickets for just 30 runs on his debut for Oxford University in 1907. In the next game, he did even better, with six Worcestershire wickets for 43 runs in the first innings, and nine in the match. He was unable to sustain this success, but did enough to be awarded his Blue by appearing in the University Match against Cambridge University where, bowling in tandem with Humphrey Gilbert, he took seven wickets in all and gave Oxford a first- innings lead, but ended up on the losing side. When the university cricket season was over for 1907, Lowe made a single appearance for Warwickshire in a County Championship game against Hampshire, but he took only one wicket and did not play for the county again. In both 1908 and 1909, Lowe continue to play for Oxford University, and in 1908 he achieved both his best bowling and batting performances. In the match against Surrey, after Oxford had been made to follow on. Lowe's batting, hitherto negligible, contributed 46 runs against some none- too- demanding Surrey bowling, before he was a rare victim for Jack Hobbs. In a run-heavy game against the Gentlemen of England immediately before the 1908 University Match, he took eight first- innings wickets for 144 runs and then, because the match was being used as a trial, was not bowled at all in the second innings, so that he never did achieve 10 wickets in a game. He took five wickets in the 1908 University Match and was batting when Oxford secured a narrow two- wicket victory. He had less success in 1909, but still did enough to secure a third Blue, though he took only one wicket in the University Match of that year. In 1910, Lowe returned to Oxford for a fourth academic year and appeared in many of the first- class matches, but he lost form and was left out of the side to meet Cambridge. He did not play again in first- class cricket after this. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack states that he also won a Blue for field hockey and was a good golfer. Lowe's later career is not always clear: he appears to have been in the Royal Naval Reserve during the First World War. In the 1920s, he was mentioned in the London Gazette as an officer in the Royal Air Force, from which he retired with the rank of wing commander in 1938.

Major Henry Astell Law, 7th Baron Ellenborough( 11 July 1889 – 19 May 1945), was a member of the House of Lords.

On the death of his father, Cecil Law, 6th Baron Ellenborough, in 1931, he succeeded to the peerage. He was commissioned as an officer into the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and served in World War I. Law was awarded the Military Cross and mentioned in despatches twice for gallantry. He was promoted to the rank of Major. He was appointed one of His Majesty's Bodyguard of Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms in 1934 and a Deputy Lieutenant of Dorset. Lord Ellenborough took a prominent part in the local affairs of Dorset and he did good work as Chairman to the Council for the Preservation of Rural England for the county. Henry Astell Law married Helen Dorothy Lovatt in 1923, only daughter of H. W. Lovatt. They had two sons: Richard Edward Cecil Law, 8th Baron Ellenborough, and the Hon. Cecil Towry Henry Law. He died in 1945.

My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 American independent adventure drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant, loosely based on Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 Henry IV, Part 2, and Henry V, and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel City of Night and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf.  My Own Private Idaho had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly. The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics.  My Own Private Idaho is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking. Since its 1991 release, the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a cult classic, especially among LGBT audiences. The film is notable for its then- taboo subject matter and avant- garde style.

296,"Lavinia Jannetta Horton Ryves, née Lavinia Serres( 16 March 1797 – 7 December 1871), was a British woman claiming to be a member of the British royal family, calling herself Princess Lavinia of Cumberland. Born in Liverpool, England, Lavinia was the daughter of Olivia Serres and John Thomas Serres. Olivia Serres gained notoriety by claiming to be the daughter of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, a younger brother of King George III of the United Kingdom. In 1822 Lavinia married Anthony Ryves, a portrait painter. They were divorced in 1841. In 1844 Princess Lavinia tried to take Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington to court for having overlooked, as George III's executor, a bequest of £ 15,000 to Olivia. In 1850 Lavinia published a pamphlet requesting financial aid from Queen Victoria. In 1866, aged sixty- nine, Princess Lavinia asked the Court of Probate to declare her the legitimate granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland and award her the £ 15,000 bequest left by George III. In the process of the 1866 trial, Lavinia produced several remarkable documents attesting to her claims, and a handwriting expert testified to the authenticity of George III's and James Wilmot's signatures. Testimony was introduced that in fact the Duke of Kent had supported Olivia financially, and had spoken of Olivia as my cousin Serres, apparently believing her story. The trial was most considered remarkable, perhaps, for the claims made by Dr. Walter Smith, Lavinia's barrister, that George III had been privately married to a Quaker, Hannah Lightfoot, and that in consequence thereof, neither George IV nor Queen Victoria had any right to the throne. Lavinia's case, however, quickly ran into difficulties: in some of the submitted documents, George III had signed his name as George Guelph; in others, William Pitt and Lord Brook had signed as earls before they had in fact become earls. The court found that Lavinia was the legitimate daughter of John and Olivia Serres and was not the granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland. The court did not prosecute Lavinia for forgery: Lavinia maintained she believed in good faith that the documents left her by Olivia were genuine. It is thought that the documents were in fact forged at the behest of Olivia, rather than Lavinia, perhaps by William FitzClarence, Olivia's boyfriend, who had calligraphic talents. Lavinia continued to write pamphlets in support of her claims, and her case was reheard by the House of Lords. She died with her claims unrecognized.

Which country Anthemiolus's father is from?",germany,roman empire,0.23592700064182281,0.0,False
301,"Anthemiolus (died c. 471 AD) was the son of the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius (467–472) and Marcia Euphemia, daughter of the Eastern Roman emperor Marcian. His name means little Anthemius and is a diminutive of his and his father's name Anthemius, in order to distinguish them both. His life is known only from the Chronica Gallica of 511. He was sent by his father to Gaul with a powerful army, accompanied by three generals — Thorisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus — in order to oppose the Visigoths then occupying Provence and threatening to conquer the Auvergne. He and his generals were defeated by the Visigothic king Euric near Arles and all four of them lost their lives. The Chronica, in entry 649, states: Antimolus a patre Anthemio imperatore cum Thorisario, Everdingo et Hermiano com. stabuli Arelate directus est, quibus rex Euricus trans Rhodanum occurrit occisisque ducibus omnia vastavit Antimolus was sent by his father, Emperor Anthemius, to Arles, with Thorisarius, Everdingus and Hermanius, comes [or comitesstabuli: King Euric met them on the far side of the Rhone and, having killed the duces, laid everything waste. According to the Chronica, this event falls between the succession of Euric (467) and the war between Anthemius and Ricimer (471–472). It can probably be further narrowed to the period when Anthemius is known to have been organising a concerted effort to remove the Visigoths from Gaul between 468 and 471, a period during which an army led by the Briton Riothamus was defeated near Déols. It is not impossible that Anthemiolus' army was sent to reinforce Riothamus and that Euric defeated both forces in turn, probably in either 470 or 471.

Aristobulus IV (31–7 BC) was a prince of Judea from the , and was married to his cousin, Berenice, daughter of Costobarus and Salome I. He was the son of Herod the Great and his second wife, Mariamne I, the last of the Hasmoneans, and was thus a descendant of the Hasmonean Dynasty. Aristobulus lived most of his life outside of Judaea, having been sent at age 12 along with his brother Alexander to be educated at the Imperial court of Rome in 20 BC, in the household of Augustus himself. Aristobulus was only 3 when his paternal aunt Salome contrived to have his mother executed for adultery. When the attractive young brothers returned to Jerusalem in 12 BC, the populace received them enthusiastically. That, along with their perceived imperious manner, picked up after having lived much of their lives at the very heart of Roman imperial power, often offended Herod. They also attracted the jealousy of their older half-brother, Antipater II, who deftly incited the aging king's anger with rumors of his favored sons' disloyalty. After many failed attempts at reconciliation between the king and his designated heirs, the ailing Herod had Aristobulus and Alexander strangled on charges of treason in 7 BC, and raised Antipater to the rank of his co-regent and heir apparent. Herod, however, retained affection for Aristobulus' children, three of whom, Agrippa I, Herod and Herodias, lived to play important roles in the next generation of Jewish rulers. A fourth, Aristobulus' eldest daughter Mariamne, was the wife of Antipater II at the time of his execution and, thereafter, may have been the wife of Ethnarch Herod Archelaus.

Princess Anle( )( 684? – 21 July 710), personal name Li Guo'er( ), was a princess of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. She was the youngest daughter of Emperor Zhongzong and his wife Empress Wei. Popular history holds that she was doted upon heavily by her parents and siblings, which contributed to her later drive for power. Eventually, after Emperor Zhongzong died in 710 — a death that traditional historians assert was a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and Li Guo'er( so that Empress Wei could reign and Li Guo'er could become crown princess) -- a coup led by Li Guo'er's cousin Li Longji the Prince of Linzi and Li Guo'er's paternal aunt Princess Taiping overthrew and killed Empress Wei and Li Guo'er.

Princess Li Jingshou () (died 437?) was a princess of the Chinese/Xiongnu state Northern Liang. Her husband was Juqu Mujian (Prince Ai). Li Jingshou was the daughter of the Western Liang prince Li Gao and Lady Yin, who was later princess dowager when Li Jingshou's brother Li Xin became prince in 417. When he was subsequently defeated and killed in 420 by the Northern Liang prince Juqu Mengxun, the Western Liang capital Jiuquan (, in modern Jiuquan, Gansu) fell to Northern Liang, and Princess Dowager Yin and Li Jingshou were captured.

Described as ‘a simple story of the novelette type,’ it apparently has some ‘interesting scenes of the interior of an iron foundry.’ The reviewer – credited only as Lantern Man by The Yorkshire Evening Post – is not that enthusiastic: ‘Although containing nothing new, it is thoroughly clean and wholesome, and possesses that “heart” interest so dear to most cinemagoers.’ This ‘heart interest’ is based upon Muir’s journey from the slums of Sheffield – ‘wherein the “motherly” child “minds” the unwashed ragged urchins, who are not poor because “the poor are only those who feel poor”‘ – to a new life as the ‘young lady of a mansion.’ In the view of Lantern Man, it ‘has an appeal that makes for popularity.’

He and his first wife, Margaret O'Brien (daughter of Murrough) were divorced after he claimed that she worked witchcraft against him. As a result of his father's multiple marriages and relationships there were a number of candidates contending for title Earl of Clanricarde. Richard, the oldest legitimate son, was the eventual successor. He was sporadically opposed by his brothers and half-brothers, including John, who claimed the title in 1568. Richard extended his influence at the expense of the O'Kelly's and the O'Madden's in the east of County Galway, overlordship over the O'Shaughnessey in the south, while allying himself with the O'Conor Don and the O'Brien of Thomond. Other minor allies included the MacCostelloe and MacMorris, who acknowledged him to avoid encroachment from the Bourkes of Mayo. In 1559 Clanricarde fought on the losing side at the Battle of Spancel Hill in County Clare as part of the Gaelic O'Brien succession dispute. From around 1570 his sons rebelled against him and the Anglo-Irish government. That decade witnessed regular warfare across the county which devastated towns such as Galway, Athenry and Loughrea. At the time of his death Burke had endured imprisonment in Dublin, and repeated treachery by his sons. After his death, further warfare was avoided when Ulick Burke killed his brother, John of the Shamrocks, and was acknowledged as the 3rd Earl of Clanricarde. He was called Sassanach (Saxon, or Englishman), because of his association with the Anglo-Irish. He died on 24 July 1582.

He became Lord Lieutenant of County Galway in 1680 and its Chief Governor in 1687. His first wife was Lettice Shirley, daughter of Sir Henry Shirley and Lady Dorothy Devereux and granddaughter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. By her he had three sons including his heir, Richard. His second wife was Helen, daughter of Donough MacCarty, 1st Earl of Clancarty, by whom he had two sons and two daughters.

When restored, the Clanricarde estates were heavily in debt and a great deal of litigation was ongoing between the interested parties.

John II of Baden was the third son of Margrave Jacob I of Baden-Baden and his wife Catherine de Lorraine. John was given a strict religious upbringing, as he was destined from an early age for an ecclesiastical career. At the urging of his father, most of his siblings also followed a religious career, the exceptions being his two oldest brothers Charles I and Bernard II and his sister Margaret. He studied in Erfurt, Pavia and Cologne from 1452 to 1456, together with his younger brothers George and Mark. On 21 June 1456, at the age of 22, he was elected Archbishop of Trier as John II of Baden. His mother was from Lorraine and had connections with Trier. Pope Calixtus III confirmed him as administrator of Trier, because he had not yet reached the minimum age of 35 for consecration as bishop. When he reached that age in 1465, he was consecrated by his suffragan bishop Hubertis Agrippina and the bishops of Metz and Worms. In 1459, Diether von Isenburg was elected Archbishop of Mainz, ahead of Adolph II of Nassau by a narrow margin. However, the Pope did not confirm Dieter's election. This led to the Baden-Palatinate War, in which John II and his brothers participated on the side of Adolph II of Nassau. John II of Baden supported reform in the Benedictine monasteries and encouraged them to join the Bursfelde Congregation. In 1469, he sent Johann Fart, the prior of the St. Mary monastery in Trier to the Maria Laach Abbey, where Johann acted as a reformer abbot. Johann was the 21st abbott, his tenure lasted from 1470 to 1491. By appointing Johann, John II thwarted the intentions of Archbishop Rupert of Cologne, who had a different reform candidate in mind. During John II's reign, the long-anticipated University of Trier was founded on 16 March 1473. The University provided coursed in theology, philosophy, medicine and law. In 1477, he officiated in the wedding of Maximilian of Habsburg and Mary of Burgundy. On 16 January 1500, he appointed his great-nephew Jakob as co-adjutor with the right to succeed  and from 1501, Jakob led the government of the Electorate. John II died in 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein (now part of Koblenz), after a tenure of 46 years, 7 months and 18 days, the longest of any bishop of Trier. He was buried in the Cathedral of Trier in a magnificent grave that he had built during his lifetime.

Where did Meritaten's father die?",amarna,akhetaten,0.34547221660614014,0.0,False
353,"Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty. Her name means She who is beloved of Aten; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped. She held several titles, performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare, who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten. Meritaten also may have served as pharaoh in her own right under the name, Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten.

Meritaten Tasherit, which means Meritaten the Younger was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Meritites I was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 4th dynasty. Her name means Beloved of her Father. Several of her titles are known from a stela found at Giza.

With Khufu, she was the mother of the Crown Prince Kawab, and possibly Djedefre. Both Queen Hetepheres II and Pharaoh Khafra have been suggested as children of Meretites I and Khufu as well, and it is possible that Meritites II was a daughter of Meritites I as well. Auguste Mariette recorded a stela at Giza in which Meritites is said to be a favorite of both Sneferu and Khufu: King’s wife, his beloved, devoted to Horus, Mertitytes. King’s wife, his beloved, Mertitytes; beloved of the Favorite of the Two Goddesses; she who says anything whatsoever and it is done for her.

She was also close to her sickly brother Henry. On one Pentecost Eve, Henry and Eleanor were given two partridges for their dinner, for a special treat. For a long period Eleanor was betrothed to King Alfonso III of Aragon. Alfonso's parents were under papal interdict, however, because of their claims to the throne of Sicily, which were contrary to the papal donation of the Sicilian throne to Charles I of Naples, and despite the Aragonese ruler's repeated pleas that Edward I send his daughter to them for marriage, Edward refused to send her as long as the interdict remained in place. In 1282 he declined one such request by saying that his wife and mother felt the girl, who had just turned 13, was too young to be married, and that they wanted to wait another two years before sending her to Aragon. Alfonso died before the marriage could take place. Eleanor subsequently married the French nobleman, Henry III, Count of Bar on September 20, 1293, and had two children: According to Kenneth Panton, Eleanor is credited with a daughter called Eleanor (b.1285), who supposedly married a Welshman named Llywelyn ap Owain.

I Miss You is an homage to Cyrus' late grandfather, Ron Cyrus, who died on February 28, 2006. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, and, seeing her grandfather nearing death, Cyrus wanted to write him a song prior to his death. It was released to Radio Disney mid-year 2007 as promotion for the dual disc . The song is a ballad with rock and country influences. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics; some commented on how it deviated from her usual material at the time and how effective the message was. I Miss You appeared on two United States charts: it peaked at number nine on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, an extension of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and at number ninety-two on the defunct Pop 100.

 I Miss You is a song by American recording artist Beyoncé, taken from her fourth studio album, 4( 2011). It was written by Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyoncé and Taylor. The song's development was motivated the fact that Beyoncé wanted to focus on songs being classics, songs that would last, and songs that she could sing when she becomes old. A mid-paced R&B ballad, I Miss You is influenced by the ballads of the 1980s. Its instrumentation consists essentially of synthesizers and keyboards.  I Miss You finds Beyoncé, as the protagonist, thinking deeply over her relationship with her love interest from whom she parted; however, she still pines for him and feels self- conscious for doing so.  I Miss You was generally praised by music critics who complimented its very sparse production as well as its aurally remarkable 1980s influence. Some of them also described the song as a haunting ballad and called it the highlight of the record. Critics also complimented how Beyoncé's vocals keep on alternating from desperate and calm throughout the song, and highlighted the vulnerability in her voice. Following the release of 4 in early July 2011, I Miss You charted at number 184 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 34 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart, based on downloads alone.

Hans Gerle( c. 1500, Nuremberg- 1570, Nuremberg) was a German lutenist and arranger of the Renaissance. Little concrete information is available regarding Gerle's life. His father was probably Conrad Gerle( died 1521), one of the city's better- known lute makers. Gerle likely spent his entire life in Nuremberg. Gerle published three volumes of lute music through Hieronymus Formschneider, a Nuremberg publisher. The first two were issued in 1532- 33, and the last in 1552; this third volume refers to Gerle as the elder on the title page, so it is presumed that Gerle had either a son or another relative with the same name. The first publication contains an introduction to the performance of lute, viola da gamba( Grossgeigen), and rebec( Kleingeigen), as well as an explanation of musical notation, and is a significant source of information on performance practice. The book is primarily made up of intabulations of German composers such as Ludwig Senfl, Johann Walter, Heinrich Isaac, Thomas Stoltzer, and Paul Hofhaimer. His second volume, for solo lute, features works from many older composers, such as Hayne van Ghizeghem, Josquin des Prez, Isaac, and Jacob Obrecht, as well as popular contemporaries such as Claudin de Sermisy, Adrian Willaert, Jean Mouton, and Senfl. The third volume was a transcription into German tablature of pieces previously only available in Italian tablature, including works of Giovanni Maria da Crema, Domenico Bianchini, Simon Gintzler, Francesco Canova da Milano, Pietro Paolo Borrono, and Alberto da Ripa.

Where was the place of death of James Adam (Architect)'s father?",nuremberg,edinburgh,0.15324121713638306,0.0,False
387,"James Adam (21 July 1732 – 20 October 1794) was a Scottish architect and furniture designer, but was often overshadowed by his older brother and business partner, Robert Adam. They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the Grand Tour, leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768–1772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771–5 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived — he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

Robert Adam (3 July 1728 – 3 March 1792) was a Scottish neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer. He was the son of William Adam (1689–1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the Adam Style, and his theory of movement in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses. He served as the member of Parliament for Kinross-shire from 1768 to 1774.

Maurice Arthur Mendes de Leon( 4 July 1856, Bruges- 16 December 1924, Amsterdam) was a Dutch physician, considered one of the founding fathers of gynaecology in the Netherlands, partly because of his surgical skills, but also due to his study into the interaction between gynaecological and psychological problems. Mendes de Leon was the son of Isaac Mendes de Leon( 1808 – 1856) and Annely F. Phillips and grandson of Amsterdam city council member Jacobo Abraham Mendes de Leon( 1784- 1842) whose father, Abraham Jacob Mendes de Leon( 1764- 1818), was also an Amsterdam city council member. He grew up in his mothers country, England, until the age of ten, after which the family moved to Amsterdam. He studied medicines at the University of Amsterdam and in 1881 obtained a PhD at the University of Heidelberg. In 1882 he married his distant relative Anna Mathilde Teixeira de Mattos( 1862– 1937). He promoted gynaecology in the Netherlands as a separate speciality, partly because of the new surgical possibilities following the discoveries of anaesthesia and antisepsis and in 1889 he started a private gynaecological clinic at the Sarphatistraat in Amsterdam. In his clinic he devoted himself to the surgery of ovarian tumours, uterus myomatosus and genital prolapse, but also to the diagnosis and treatment of supposed inflammations of the cervix and endometrium as cause of psychological disorders. In this he followed the opinions of contemporary English gynaecologists. As he was not aware of physiological histology, he nearly always found signs of inflammation. He treated this with curettage and drastic caustics, sometimes after using a dilation knife( hysterotome) for the cervix. At the turn of the twentieth century Dutch gynaecologists such as Treub and Nijhoff began to cast doubt on such theories of reflex neurosis, but Mendes de Leon persisted in his views.

Charles Rich, 4th Earl of Warwick (abt 1623 – 24 Aug 1673), styled The Honourable Charles Rich until 1658, was an English peer and politician. Rich was the second son of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick and Frances Hatton. As a young man he was noted for being handsome, charming, cheerful and penniless. His wife was Lady Mary Boyle, daughter of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, and his second wife Catherine Fenton. He became intimate with Lady Mary when he helped to nurse her through an attack of measles. It was a love marriage: Mary to her father's intense displeasure, had refused to enter the marriage arranged by him with James Hamilton, later Earl of Clanbrassil, on the grounds that she found him repulsive, and chose Charles instead. Her father who was genuinely fond of her despite their differences eventually gave his consent, as well as a generous dowry, but the couple do not seem to have been happy. Mary in her diaries refers to violent and passionate disputes. There may have been faults on both sides, since Mary was exceptionally stubborn and strong- minded (as shown by her defiance of her formidable father), and in later years became almost fanatically devout, but it was generally agreed that the greater blame lay with Rich, whose chronic ill-health made him bad-tempered and tyrannical. In public life Rich represented Sandwich in Parliament from 1645 to 1648. He was also Custos Rotulorum of Essex. He succeeded his brother Robert in the earldom in 1658.

406,"Miss Seventeen is a reality television show on MTV that aired from October 17, 2005 to December 19, 2005. The show consisted of 17 young women competing for an internship at and a college scholarship. Atoosa Rubenstein was the main judge, she was the youngest editor-in-chief ever to run Seventeen magazine. They picked 17 girls from around the United States who were not only photogenic but also had been at the top of their class, to provide a role model for young women. The girls were flown to New York, where they would take part in a contest similar in format to The Apprentice — they would be given tasks to be done by Atoosa, and in each episode one of the girls would be eliminated from the competition. The winner would get her face on the cover of Seventeen magazine, a college scholarship and would be offered an internship job on the magazine. The criteria for elimination were not only performing poorly — Atoosa was watchful of how the girls talked when no one else was in the room, via cameras set up around the house. In this manner, she could watch the girls with their guards down and see what their real motivations and dreams were. In one elimination, for example, Atoosa sat down with the girl and explained that she didn't feel that the girl was in the contest for the 'right' reasons — video clips were shown to the viewers which showed the girl talking to her other roommates and explaining that she was more interested in the face-time she would get for being part of an MTV show. Where the format differed from other shows was in the first elimination round and in how the contestants found out who was eliminated. In the first episode, all 17 girls sat around the dinner table with Atoosa and had to describe in brief who they were and what they hoped they would get out of the experience. Based on this conversation, Atoosa eliminated 7 of the girls from the contest. The way the girls would generally find out who was eliminated was by sitting around a TV as Atoosa would talk to them, telling them the results of the tasks they were given. The TV screen would then display the names of the girls who would be staying in the house, written in cursive form. The girl whose name didn't appear on 'The List' was eliminated, and met with Atoosa to hear her reasoning for why she was eliminated. In the final episode, Jennifer Steele was declared the winner, with her magazine cover unveiled in Times Square. It was also revealed that Brianne Burrowes, who voluntarily left the show in an early episode of the series, was offered a job by Atoosa and will be working with Jennifer in their respective internships at the magazine.

This woman was believed to be a banshee foretelling his death the next day when he lay dead with his clothes caked in blood on the battlefield of Dysert O'Dea (Lewis Spence, The Magical Arts in Celtic Britain 81(1999)). Richard was succeeded by his son Thomas, who was born in 1318 and died three years later. A series of inquisitions post mortem that were held following a writ issued on 10 April 1321 established that Thomas' heirs were his father's sisters; Margaret, the wife of Bartholomew de Badlesmere and Maud, the wife of Sir Robert de Welle. As well as stewardship of the Forest of Essex, Thomas' estate included numerous properties in Ireland.

The Raj Bhavan, formerly known during British India as the Bangalore Residency, the Mysore State Residency, or, simply, the Residency, is the official residence of the Governor of Karnataka. It is located in the capital city of Bangalore, Karnataka. During Mysore Kingdom, the building was home to the Resident of the British Agency that was in subsidiary alliance with the Kingdom of Mysore. Situated at the highest point in Bangalore, High Grounds( 3031 feet above sea level), it was built by Sir Mark Cubbon between 1840 and 1842 when he was the Commissioner of Mysore territories of the British. After Cubbon left in 1861, the bungalow was put up for sale and purchased by the succeeding commissioner, Lewin Bentham Bowring, using government funds, and became the official residence of the Commissioner. A ballroom was constructed in 1874 when the King Edward VII, Prince of Wales, visited India. It was named' Serapis Room' after the ship which brought the Prince to Bombay. Many changes were made to the building during its existence in the British Raj. In 1881, when power over the territory was transferred back to the Mysore Royal family, the office of the Commissioner was abolished. The building became the official residence of the Resident and came to be called the Residency till the Independence of India( 15 August 1947) when the Residency was abolished. The Constitution of Independent India created the office of the Raj Pramukh( Governor). The Maharaja of Mysore was made the first Raj Pramukh of Mysore. Although the Residency was converted to the official residence of the Raj Pramukh, the Maharaja of Mysore chose not to stay there, preferring his own palaces at Bangalore and Mysore. Hence, the Residency was converted to a state guesthouse by the Government of India. State guests such as the President of India, the Vice President of India, central government ministers and chief ministers of other states stayed at the Residency. The Chief Minister of Karnataka hosted parties at the Residency. On Independence Day and Republic Day, parties were hosted by the Raj Pramukh, a tradition that has continued till now. The Residency was also used by the Congress party for its legislature party meetings. During Franklin D. Roosevelt's visit to India, his wife Eleanor Roosevelt stayed at the Residency. In 1964, the then Maharaja of Mysore, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar, became the Governor of Madras, and relinquished his gubernatorial post in Mysore. General S M Srinagesh succeeded him, and moved into the Raj Bhavan. It has been the residence of the Governor of the state since. Originally a single storeyed building, the Raj Bhavan was expanded by the addition of a first floor in 1967, built carefully to adhere to the architectural style of the original structure. The art collection comprises paintings of a variety of Indian schools of art, as well as some from the West. The residence is surrounded by beautiful gardens stretching over. The garden is fringed with century old pine and fir trees, and has an artificial waterfall.

Anniyan  is a 2005 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film written and directed by S. Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran of Aascar Films. The plot centres on a disillusioned everyman whose frustration at what he sees as increasing social apathy and public negligence leads to a split personality that attempts to right the system. Vikram stars as Ambi, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who has multiple personality disorder and develops two other identities: a metrosexual fashion model named Remo, and a murderous vigilante named Anniyan. Sadha plays his love interest, Nandini. Actors Nedumudi Venu, Vivek, Prakash Raj, and Nassar also feature in the film. Shankar conceived the film in mid-2003 during the post-production period of his previous film, Boys. He based the film on his own life experiences during his formative years when he was disturbed by what he saw around him, and his eventual displeasure with society. Pre-production for Anniyan began in November 2003 and principal photography in March 2004. The making of the film, which included numerous production delays, took 14 months. The film was shot at Hyderabad, Thanjavur, Viluppuram and Chennai, and the song sequences were filmed in Mumbai, Malaysia, Amsterdam and Tenkasi. The film was notable for its recreation of the Tyagaraja Aradhana music festival and the extensive use of time slice photography in an action sequence. Cinematographer V. Manikandan abandoned the project halfway through, until he was replaced with Ravi Varman. The technical departments were headed by V. T. Vijayan (editing), Sabu Cyril (production design), and Peter Hein (stunt choreography), and the soundtrack was composed by Harris Jayaraj, who was in his first collaboration with the director. The film was touted as the director's magnum opus and was budgeted at 263.8 million, making it at the time of its release the most expensive South Indian film ever made. Notably, it was the first South Indian film to obtain institutional finance, and it had the highest insurance coverage available for films at that time.

Further, the film was also dubbed into French and released in French-speaking countries worldwide by Columbia Tristar. While the film was a commercial success across South India, the Hindi version received a lukewarm response and was a box-office failure. Anniyan received positive responses from critics and audience alike and, together with its dubbed versions, grossed 570 million in its lifetime run. In addition to winning eight Filmfare Awards and six State Film Awards, the film won a National Award in the Special Effects category.

 Part of Your World is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for Disney's animated feature film The Little Mermaid( 1989). Performed by American actress and singer Jodi Benson in the titular role as Ariel, a mermaid princess, Part of Your World is a power ballad in which the main character expresses her strong desire to become human; its lyrics use placeholder names in lieu of several human- related terms that would be unfamiliar to a mermaid. The film's theme song, Part of Your World is reprised by Ariel after she rescues Eric, a human prince with whom she has fallen in love, from drowning. Directly influenced by Broadway and musical theatre, Ashman strongly believed that The Little Mermaid would benefit from an I Want song – a musical number during which the main character sings about what they hope to accomplish by the end of their story. Directors Ron Clements and John Musker originally asked Ashman to write a song for Ariel in which she expresses her romantic feelings for Prince Eric, but the lyricist felt that a song that details the character's fascination with the human world would better serve the film's plot. Ashman recruited Benson, with whom he had previously collaborated on the stage musical Smile( 1986), to record Part of Your World, and worked closely with her to ensure that she delivered a desirable performance. Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg initially ordered that Part of Your World be removed from the final film due to concerns that the ballad would bore young children. However, Ashman, Clements, Musker and animator Glen Keane ultimately convinced Katzenberg that Part of Your World is essential to the film's narrative, and the song was spared after audiences appeared to enjoy it during a subsequent test screening.  Part of Your World has garnered critical acclaim; both film and music critics praised the song's quality and Benson's vocal performance. Several media publications agree that Part of Your World ranks among the greatest Disney songs ever written, and credit the success of the ballad with making I Want songs a standard component of future animated musical films. Critics have offered various interpretations of the song's empowering lyrics, ranging from seeking independence from overprotective parents to feminism and LGBT rights. In addition to becoming Benson's signature song, which she continues to perform live, Part of Your World has been covered extensively by several artists of various genres, including Faith Hill, Jessica Simpson, Miley Cyrus, Bruno Mars, Carly Rae Jepsen, Jessie J and Sara Bareilles.

Massacre Mafia Style( also known as The Executioner or Like Father, Like Son) is a 1974 independent film written, directed, produced by, and starring Italian- American crooner- actor Duke Mitchell. The tagline for the film was You ’re IN, or you ’re IN THE WAY.  Massacre Mafia Style was written, produced, self- financed and directed by Duke Mitchell, and was accumulated from all of his real- life run-ins with similar characters and mob stories. Duke Mitchell was an actor and singer( providing the singing voice of Fred Flintstone in The Flintstones cartoons) and was once part of a comedy duo with partner Sammy Petrillo who together starred in the 1952 cult film Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla with Bela Lugosi of Dracula fame. The pair whose act, Mitchell& Petrillo, was imitative of Martin& Lewis( Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), was sued by Lewis after the Lugosi film was released. Mitchell went on to become a well- known crooner and nightclub act in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and as such, was known as the “ King ” of Palm Springs and ran in some of the same circles as pal Frank Sinatra. His nightclub act revolved around his Sinatra- like crooning and rockabilly Italian- American songs. With such behind- the- scenes access, Mitchell often used several of the nightclubs that he sang in as locations for his films; such places as The Buggy Whip in Los Angeles .<br> Mitchell would use the money he made singing to fund his independent films. Several of Mitchell's projects never saw the light of day, including his next film Gone with the Pope which only existed as a work print when it was found in a garage by Grindhouse Releasing ’s Bob Murawski and Sage Stallone. It was carefully restored and released theatrically in 2011 by Grindhouse Releasing, which has also restored and released Mitchell's Massacre Mafia Style on Blu-ray in 2015.

Ilona Eibenschütz (8 May 1873 in Budapest, Hungary – 21 May 1967 in London, England) was a Hungarian pianist. She received her first instruction in music from her cousin Albert Eibenschütz. Franz Liszt is said to have played at a concert with her when she was five years old. She later studied with Carl Marek, and from 1878 to 1885 at the Leipzig Conservatory under Hans Schmitt, and then, from 1885 to 1890, with Clara Schumann in Frankfurt. There she met Johannes Brahms in 1886, and she was close to him until his death in 1897. She heard him play his own music on various occasions, and in 1926, she wrote (as Mrs. Carl Derenburg) for The Musical Times[Brahms] played as if he were improvising, with heart and soul, sometimes humming to himself, forgetting everything around him. His playing was altogether grand and noble, like his compositions. In the summer of 1893, Brahms privately premiered his piano pieces, op. 118 and op. 119, to Eibenschütz. She later wrote, It was of course the most wonderful thing for me to hear these pieces as nobody yet knew anything about them. I was the first to whom he played them. Her teacher Clara Schumann was Brahms's closest personal and musical friend, but expressed reservations privately to Brahms about Eibenschütz's playing, writing to Brahms on 1 February 1894 that she goes too quickly over everything. (The translation is by Jerrold Northrup Moore in his booklet notes to the Pearl CD, Pupils of Clara Schumann - Pearl CDS 99049 - which includes recordings of Eibenschütz.) Starting in 1884, at the age of 12, she annually made a concert tour through Germany, Austria, France, Russia, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, playing before the Queen of Denmark at Copenhagen, before the Czar and Czarina of Russia at the Gatschina Palace, and before the Emperor of Austria at Vienna, by whom she was granted an imperial stipend for five years. Her debut with the Berlin Philharmonic was on 7 November 1890.

Deviations from the original book were either limited to budget restrictions or moderate artistic liberty: While it seems not credible that the Nemo of the book achieved various, physically demanding stunts( considering he was weakened and subsequently dying of old age), Omar Sharif is much younger, relies on what's left of his crew( killed by some kind of disease, most likely radiation poisoning) and eventually shares the same fate as his alter ego James Mason in the Disney version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

This got the attention of Spinefarm Records and led to a professional contract. Their career truly began progressing after the release of the album Be My God – from 2001 – which was issued as they went on a joint tour with the power metal band Edguy. However, vocalist Tanya Kemppainen quit the band in 2002, leaving Lullacry without its main element. Many female singers applied for the post, but the then unknown contralto vocalist Tanja Lainio was ultimately chosen as the replacement vocalist. Their following release was entitled Crucify My Heart. The single Do n't Touch the Flame taken from this album included a cover of the Nine Inch Nails track Head Like a Hole. Prior to the recording of their fourth album, the EP Fire Within was released including alternative versions of two of the band's classic tracks, a W.A.S.P. cover L.O.V.E. Machine, and two new tracks. In June 2005 the band announced the completion of their fourth album entitled Vol. 4, which was released in September the same year. The single Stranger in You, which included a Kiss cover of I Stole Your Love, was released in July. After a long hiatus, Lullacry released their fifth studio album Where Angels Fear in 2012. It was released through band's own label, OUTO recordings, distributed by Playground Scandinavia, and was licensed to Europe, Japan, North America, Russia, Belarus& Ukraine. In February 2013 Lullacry released a new video and digi-single for the song To Every Heartache. They did some shows during 2013, basically in Finland, to celebrate their 15- year career, but officially ceased their activities in 2014.

491,"Rodrigo Gómez (died 1146) was a Castilian nobleman and military leader under Alfonso VII. He governed large parts of Asturias and northern Castile, was involved in the politics with neighbouring Navarre, to whose royal family he was related by marriage, and took part in the Reconquista. Although he was rewarded for loyalty by his sovereign on more than one occasion, he did take part in one brief rebellion, led by a relative. His was a branch of the Lara family. Rodrigo was a son of Gómez González and Urraca Muñoz. He married Elvira, a daughter of the Navarrese infante Ramiro Sánchez, sometime before 1137, when they made a joint donation of their villa (palacio in contemporary records) at Villaverde to the monastery of San Salvador de Oña. In this donation Rodrigo expressed the wish that his gift would purchase eternal life for his lord, Alfonso VII. Elvira outlived her husband by several years, making another donation to Oña on 18 February 1161 just before her departure on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The couple produced three sons, each of whom became counts: Álvaro, Gómez, and Gonzalo. According to one historian, Rodrigo first appears in royal documents in 1119, eight years after his father's death at the Battle of Candespina (1111). Another historian cites a document of 13 February 1121 in the archives of the monastery of Sahagún, a favoured royal residence, as his first public appearance. After the death of Queen Urraca on 8 March 1126, Rodrigo and his brother Diego were among the first to do homage to her successor, Alfonso VII. In this connexion, they are the first Castilians listed by the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, which says of Rodrigo postea ab eo factus est consullater made count by him [the king]). On 17 June 1126 Rodrigo made a donation to the Benedictine monastery of San Pedro de las Dueñas. He made many other donations to the Benedictine monastery at Oña, both before and after his marriage (e.g. 1142). Early in Alfonso's reign Rodrigo began to accrue positions in Castile. On 13 September 1129 he was holding Cervera and Mudá from the king. On 16 November 1129 he was recorded as holding Briviesca. After the rebellion of Rodrigo González de Lara in 1130, Rodrigo Gómez was his replacement as governor of Asturias de Santillana, although the first charter that records him as such dates to 2 December 1131. He continued to govern that region for the rest of his life. He was also the recipient of royal largesse in October 1130. By 1 June 1131 Rodrigo had been given the title count (comes or consul), the highest dignity in the realm. At the same time he is first mentioned ruling Bureba, which he held onto until at least 25 February 1144. His son Gonzalo would also rule Bureba for most of his career. A private charter from the abbey of San Salvador de Oña, dated to November 1129, shows Rodrigo as lord in that region. At about the same time, a royal charter of Alfonso I of Aragon and Navarre enacted at Briviesca on 10 October 1129, names Fortún Garcés Cajal as holding the tenancy of Bureba. These two charters indicate the contested nature of this frontier district. At a local level the king of León's man was recognised and active as tenant, but when the king of Aragon was present, his choice of tenant, in this case his most powerful magnate, was enforced. In 1132 Rodrigo supported his kinsman, Gonzalo Peláez, then in revolt in western Asturias, and rapidly fell from favour. The king was assembling an army at Atienza for a war with Alfonso of Aragon and Navarre when he learned of the insurrection. He changed plans and led his army into Asturias, where he seized [Rodrigo Gómez], and he stripped him of his honor and sent him away, according to the Chronica Adefonsi (I, §30). There is some dispute whether the Rodrigo of the rebellion was the same as the count, but if he was the latter he was soon restored. He was still at court on 28 May 1132 and had already returned to favour by January 1133. On 19 December 1135 Rodrigo and his sisters, Sancha and Estefanía, made a donation to Oña for the sake of their late brother Diego's soul. On 21 November 1137 Alfonso VII granted Rodrigo a series of estates in gratitude for his loyal service, the events of 1132 apparently notwithstanding. By 14 September 1138 Rodrigo had been appointed governor of Belorado, a post which he held until 1144, at which time he also appeared briefly ruling Cerezo. In 1139 he participated in the Siege of Oreja throughout the summer and into the autumn. On 22 February 1140 Rodrigo was witness to a treaty between Alfonso VII and Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona at Carrión de los Condes. Later that year, Rodrigo, with Gutierre Fernández de Castro and a certain Lope López, waged war on García Ramírez of Navarre on behalf of Alfonso VII. García of Navarre was in fact Rodrigo's brother-in-law. By 27 January 1141 Rodrigo was recorded as ruling Castile, a reference to Castella Vetula (Old Castile) in the north of the kingdom, territory which bordered Asturias de Santillana. He continued to hold it until his death. In 1142 he was appointed tutor or guardian of García, the youngest son of Alfonso VII. That same year Rodrigo confirmed the donation he and Elvira had made in 1137 of their villa at Villaverde to Oña, this time extending his hopes to include the eternal life of his ward García. The young García died in 1145. In 1144 Rodrigo and Gutierre Fernández escorted the king of Navarre, against whom they had been fighting four years previous, from León to Pamplona with his new bride, Urraca, the daughter of Alfonso VII. The escorts were rewarded by García, as recounted in the Chronica Adefonsi (I, §94): [At Pamplona] King García prepared a royal feast for the Castilians and for all the knights and officers of his kingdom. The celebration lasted several days. When it was over, the King gave magnificent gifts to the Castilian nobles, and each of them returned to his land. The last document citing Rodrigo as ruling Asturias and Castile dates from 19 September 1146. Shortly afterwards he made his last donation to Oña, on 21 September. The last reference to Rodrigo as still living dates to November 1146. According to the Chronicon Burgense he died that year. Surviving royal documents reveal that he spent most of his last year at court.

His struggles with the British East India Company is known as the Cotiote War. He is popularly known as Kerala Simham (Lion of Kerala) on account of his martial exploits. Pazhassi Raja was a member of the western branch of the Kottayam royal clan. When Hyder Ali of the Kingdom of Mysore occupied Malabar in 1773, the Raja of Kottayam found political asylum in Travancore. Pazhassi Raja, the fourth prince in line for succession to the throne during this period, became one of the de facto heads of state, surpassing several older royal contenders. He fought a war of resistance against the Mysorean army from 1774 to 1793. On account of his refusal to flee and due to his effective resistance to Mysoreans, he gained firm support of his subjects. In 1792, after the Third Anglo-Mysore War, the East India Company imposed control in Kottayam in violation of an earlier agreement of 1790 which had recognised its independence. Vira Varma, to whom Raja was a nephew, was appointed by the East India Company authorities as the Raja of Kottayam. To meet revenue targets fixed by Company authorities, Vira Varma ordered an exorbitant tax to be collected from the peasantry and this move was met in 1793 by a mass resistance led by Pazhassi Raja, who had always been opposed to the Company's rule. In 1796, the Company made an attempt to arrest Pazhassi Raja, but he evaded capture and instead fought back using guerilla warfare. After a string of serious setbacks, the Company sued for peace in 1797. The conflict was renewed in 1800 over a dispute on Wayanad and after a five-year-long war of insurgency, Pazhassi Raja was killed on 30 November 1805 in a gun-fight at Mavila Thodu (small body of water), in the present day Kerala-Karnataka border.

It was inspired by Joel reading a review about a particular (unnamed) band, and realizing that he had no idea what their music sounded like. The song also includes the line ``Alright Rico!

Hugo Santiago Muchnick (12 December 1939 – 27 February 2018) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and lived in France from 1959 until his death in 2018. Santiago studied Literature, Philosophy and Music. From 1959-66 he was assistant director to Robert Bresson. In 1969, he made his first feature film Invasión in his native Argentina based on an idea by celebrated writers Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges, who also co-wrote the script. Adolfo Bioy Casares described the film in May 1969 as follows:Invasión modernises the theme of The Iliad: it does not praise the shrewdness and effectiveness of the conqueror, but rather the courage of a handful of warriors ready to defend their Troy-which is far too much like Buenos Aires-where there is always a group of friends and a tango inviting you to fight for just and noble causes. Homer will forgive me: the heart is always on the side of those who resist. I believe Hugo Santiago has created an extraordinary film.

Who is Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (Executed 39)'s father-in-law?",julius caesar,germanicus,0.3744783401489258,0.0,False
572,"Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger or Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor (died 30 BC), was the only child of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and his wife Junia Secunda, a half-sister to Brutus the Younger, one of Julius Caesar's assassins.

Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus also known as Paullus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 77 BC – after 11 BC) was a Roman Senator. Paullus was a member of the gens Aemilia. He was a grandson of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Appuleia through their son Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus by his unnamed wife. His paternal uncle Marcus Aemilius Lepidus served as a member of the Second Triumvirate. Paullus served as consul in 34 BC and censor in 22. Paullus first married Cornelia( c. 54 BC- 16 BC). With Cornelia, Paullus had three children: Lucius Aemilius Paullus( c. 37 BC- 14 AD) the husband of Julia the Younger and consul in AD 1; Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 30 BC- 33 AD), consul in AD 6; and a daughter Aemilia Paulla( c. 22 BC). Aemilia was married twice: first to Lucius Munatius Plancus, consul in AD 13; second to Publius Memmius Regulus. Paullus was widowed in 18 BC, the same year Cornelia's brother Publius Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus was consul. Not long after Cornelia's death, he married Claudia Marcella Minor, one of the daughters of consul Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor and Octavia the Younger, as her maternal uncle was the Roman emperor Augustus. The marriage of Marcella and Paullus linked two honored republican houses and tied them closely to the imperial circle. At some point after 11 BC, Marcella bore him a son, Paullus Aemilius Regulus, who later served as a quaestor during the rule of the Roman emperor Tiberius.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, (6–39) was the son of consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. He and his sister Aemilia Lepida were both married to siblings of the Emperor Caligula (Aemilia married Caligula's elder brother Drusus Caesar; Lepidus married to Caligula's younger sister Julia Drusilla). He was also great-grandson of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul of 50 BC and brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Some areas of his lineage are unclear. However, through his mother Julia the Younger, Lepidus was the great grandson of Emperor Augustus Caesar. Lepidus married Caligula's sister Drusilla sometime in November or December of 37. Little is known about him prior to this. Drusilla had been married to Lucius Cassius Longinus since 33 but Caligula forced his brother-in-law to divorce Drusilla so that she could marry Lepidus. The marriage lasted until Drusilla's death in June 38. They had no children. Because of this marriage, Lepidus had become a close friend to Caligula and his family. After the death of Gemellus in 37, Lepidus was publicly marked by Caligula as his heir. In late 38, when the governor of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus was arrested, Lepidus successfully persuaded Caligula to exile Flaccus to Andros rather than Gyarus. Sometime in 39, however, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla that detailed an adulterous affair with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor. Lepidus was executed and Caligula's sisters were exiled. Agrippina was given the bones of Lepidus in an urn, and she carried them to Rome. Caligula sent three daggers to the Temple of Mars the Avenger to celebrate the death. In the Senate, Vespasian made a motion that the remains of Lepidus be thrown away instead of buried. The motion was carried and Lepidus was not given a proper burial.

575,"Charles XI, also Carl  (24 November 1655 – 5 April 1697 OS) was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611–1718). He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.

Count Carl Löwenhielm (3 November 1772 – 9 June 1861) was a Swedish military officer, diplomat, and politician. He was an illegitimate son of King Charles XIII of Sweden and Augusta von Fersen (married to the Chancellor of the Royal Court Fredrik Adolf Löwenhielm) and a half-brother of general and diplomat Gustaf Löwenhielm. Löwenhielm participated in the war operations in Finland in 1788–1790, in Pomerania in 1807, on the Norwegian border and on Åland in 1809. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1808, in 1812 to the General Adjuster, in 1814 to Major General and in 1815 to the Lieutenant-General. Löwenhielm was a member of the Swedish cabinet between 1822–1839 and represented Sweden at the Congress of Vienna.

Charles IX, also Carl (4 October 1550 – 30 October 1611), was King of Sweden from 1604 until his death. He was the youngest son of King Gustav I and his second wife, Margaret Leijonhufvud, brother of Eric XIV and John III, and uncle of Sigismund who was king of both Sweden and Poland. By his father's will he got, by way of appanage, the Duchy of Södermanland, which included the provinces of Närke and Värmland; but he did not come into actual possession of them till after the fall of Eric and the succession to the throne of John in 1568. Both Charles and one of his predecessors, Eric XIV (1560–68), took their regnal numbers according to a fictitious history of Sweden. He was actually the third Swedish king called Charles. He came into the throne by championing the Protestant cause during the increasingly tense times of religious strife between competing sects of Christianity. In just over a decade, these would break out as the Thirty Years' War. These conflicts had already caused the dynastic squabble rooted in religious freedom that deposed his nephew and brought him to rule as king of Sweden. His reign marked the start of the final chapter (dated 1648 by some) of both the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. With his brother's death in November 1592, the throne of Sweden went to his nephew and Habsburg ally, Sigismund of Poland and Sweden. During these tense political times, Charles viewed the inheritance of the throne of Protestant Sweden by his devout Roman Catholic nephew with alarm. Thus, several years of religious controversy and discord followed. During the period, Charles and the Swedish privy council ruled in Sigismund's name while he stayed in Poland. After various preliminaries, the Riksdag of the Estates forced Sigismund to abdicate the throne to Charles IX in 1595. This eventually kicked off nearly seven decades of sporadic warfare as the two lines of the divided House of Vasa both continued to attempt to remake the union between the Polish and Swedish thrones with opposing counter-claims and dynastic wars. Quite likely, the dynastic outcome between Sweden and Poland's House of Vasa exacerbated and radicalized the later actions of Europe's Catholic princes in the German states such as the Edict of Restitution. In fact, it worsened European politics to the abandonment or prevention of settling events by diplomacy and compromise during the vast bloodletting that was the Thirty Years' war.

Scarface is a 1983 American crime drama film directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. It is a remake of the 1932 film and tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana( Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug lord. The cast also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983. The film was shot in Louisville and in Los Angeles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Giorgio Moroder. De Palma dedicated this version of Scarface after the writers of the original, Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht.  Scarface was released on December 9, 1983 and grossed$ 44 million at the domestic box office and$ 65.9 million worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, however, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre, and one of the greatest remakes ever. Screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, and it has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in hip hop music as well as comic books, television programs, and video games, although over the years, the film has been regarded as a cult film.

He was the son of Iyasu I and Empress Malakotawit. He is often referred to as Irgum Tekle Haymanot or Tekle Haymanot the Cursed Tekle Haymanot became Emperor following Iyasus' retirement to an island in Lake Tana. With the support of his mother Empress Malakotawit, some of the officials argued, after the precedent of king Kaleb, that Iyasu had abdicated, and crowned Tekle Haymanot ngusä nägäst in Gondar. This act was not embraced by the entire state, and the resulting civil strife led to Iyasu's murder at the order of his son Tekle Haymanot. In September, 1707, a rebel in Gojjam declared himself ngusä nägäst under the name Amda Seyon, and made his way to the capital city, where he had himself crowned. Tekle Haymanot quickly returned to Gondar, despite the difficulty of travel during the rainy season, forced the usurper to flee, and celebrated his triumph. Amda Seyon was later killed in battle in Maitsa. However his unpopularity for having ordered the murder of his widely revered father was profound and he never overcame it. The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or Era of the Princes( a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.

Emperor Tekle Giorgis II based his claim to the Imperial throne on a dual heritage: his mother, Princess Ayichesh Tedla, was a descendant of Emperor Iyasu I also known as Atse Adyam Seged or Iyasu the Great, who was the grandson of Emperor Fasilides of the Gondar branch of the Solomonic dynasty; and via his father Wagshum Gebre Medhin, he was the heir to the old Zagwe dynasty and the rulers of Lasta and Wag. Tekle Giyorgis II's mother, Princess Ayichesh Tedla, was the daughter of the popular Dejazmach Tedla Hailu, of the Gondarine Solomonic line, heir of Lasta, and one of twelve Amhara nobles who were executed during Tewodros II's rule. Dejazmach Tedla's death had caused a rebellion in Wollo.

Tekle Giyorgis II's uncles, the sons of Dejazmach Tedla Hailu, played significant roles as members of the Gondar-Lasta Imperial House, brothers of his mother, Princess Aychesh.

Ailéan was a brother of Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí, King of Argyll and the Isles, a significant figure who held power in the mid thirteenth century. At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown. In 1259, Dubhghall's daughter married the son of King of Connacht, and Ailéan is recorded to have commanded the woman's tocher of one hundred and sixty gallowglass warriors. When the Scottish Crown encroached into Isles in the 1260s, Dubhghall and Ailéan were noted supporters of the Norwegian cause.

601,"Isetnofret was an Ancient Egyptian woman and daughter of the high priest of Ptah and king's son Khaemweset( lived around 1200 BC). She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called daughter of his body. On a relief found at Saqqara she is called his beloved daughter and king's daughter. Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the noble woman Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.

Mutnedjmet was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 21st dynasty. She was the Great Royal Wife of her brother, Psusennes I. It is generally assumed that she was the mother of Pharaoh Amenemope but, since genealogical evidence is lacking, this is primarily based on the fact that he succeeded to the throne. That she was the mother of the Crown Prince Ramesses-Ankhefenmut has been challenged an now seems unlikely. She was the daughter of High Priest of Amun Pinedjem I, who was the de facto ruler of Southern Egypt from 1070 BCE onwards, then proclaimed himself pharaoh in 1054 BCE. Her mother was Duathathor-Henuttawy, a daughter of Ramesses XI, last ruler of the 20th dynasty. Three of her brothers succeeded each other as High Priests of Amun and a sister, Maatkare became God's Wife of Amun. She was buried in the Tanis tomb of her husband, in a burial chamber parallel to his. Her burial chamber was later usurped by king Amenemope, but her name and some of her titles survived, mainly on the side of the sarcophagus which was turned to the wall. Pierre Montet believes that a depiction of Mutnedjmet on the wall of the burial chamber may have been usurped and reworked into a goddess when turning the scene into a depiction of Amenemope turned out to be too much work. The present whereabouts of her mummy remain unknown, but around 1980 some bronze ushabtis of her have surfaced on the antiquitites market which suggests that her alternative burial (or a deposit of funerary equipment) may have been discovered. Several burial items are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Her titles were: King's Daughter of His Body; King's Sister; Great Royal Wife; Lady of the Two Lands; Second Prophet of Amun in Tanis.

Sweet Dreams is a 2012 documentary film about the Rwandan women's drumming troupe Ingoma Nshya, which was founded in 2005 by playwright Odile Kiki Katese with women from both sides of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The drumming troupe's success then led to the opening of an ice cream store in 2010, which also brings together people from both sides of the genocide. The documentary was co-directed by siblings Lisa Fruchtman and Rob Fruchtman; Lisa Fruchtman had learned of the troupe and the plans for the shop from Katese in 2009.

His epithet, and that of each previous and subsequent head of his family, was coined by John Smyth of Nibley (died 1641), steward of the Berkeley estates, the biographer of the family and author of Lives of the Berkeleys. He was born in Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, the eldest son and heir of Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley by his wife Lady Margaret Mortimer. In August 1338 Berkeley married Elizabeth le Despenser, daughter of Hugh Despenser the younger by his wife Eleanor de Clare. By Elizabeth he had seven children as follows:

Maurice Berkeley, 3rd Viscount Fitzhardinge (1628 – 13 June 1690), known as Sir Maurice Berkeley, Bt from 1660 to 1668, was an English politician, of the Bruton branch of the Berkeley family. Maurice was the eldest son of Sir Charles Berkeley and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew, and was baptized on 15 June 1628. His father was the head of the branch of the Berkeley family founded by Maurice Berkeley, which was seated at Bruton, Somerset. Unlike his relatives, he took no part in the English Civil War. On 1 January 1649, he married Anne Lee, the daughter of Sir Henry Lee, 1st Baronet, by whom he had two daughters. He also had two natural sons by Mary Rutley. Anne was the stepdaughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, the Parliamentary Lord High Admiral, and Berkeley held local office under the Protectorate: he was a commissioner of assessment for Somerset in 1657, and was again appointed to the commission in January 1660. In March he was appointed to the militia commission and the commission of the peace for Somerset. Appointed a captain of militia horse in April 1660, he obtained a pass to travel overseas and brought to the court of Charles II the news of Monck's declaration in favor of restoration. He was rewarded with a baronetcy on 2 July 1660, and was appointed to the household the Duke of Gloucester in May; however, Gloucester died of smallpox in September and his appointment lapsed. In June, he was appointed an extraordinary gentleman of the privy chamber to the King. Berkeley also briefly enjoyed two revenue posts as treasurer and receiver of the Dunkirk garrison from December 1660 to 1661, and joint agent for wine licenses from 1661 to 1662.

There he served as vice-president of Connaught from 1662 to 1666: his uncle, John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, was Lord President of Connaught, although Maurice was more closely attached in politics to the Duke of Ormonde. Berkeley was also appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland in 1663 and sat in the Parliament of Ireland from 1665 to 1666. He was a commissioner of excise accounts in that country from 1666 to 1667. In England, he was appointed to the commission on loyal and indigent officers in Bristol in 1662 and was made a deputy lieutenant of Somerset. From 1673 to 1679, he was a commissioner of assessment for Wells, and from 1667 to some time before 1679, was a colonel of militia foot in Somerset.

In the spring 1679 election, Berkeley was defeated in Somerset; he was again defeated in the October election while standing for Bath. He was removed from the Somerset commission of assessment in 1680. He was returned for Bath in the 1681 election and continued to represent it until his death.

Which country Æthelwald, Ealdorman Of East Anglia's wife is from?",mercia,english,0.2808085083961487,0.0,False
632,"Æthelwald (died 962) was ealdorman of East Anglia. He is mentioned in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester along with other members of his family. He was probably the oldest son of Æthelstan Half-King and succeeded to some of his father's offices in 956 when Æthelstan became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. He was a benefactor of Ramsey Abbey and a supporter of the Benedictine reform movement which began in the reign of King Edgar. He was the first husband of Ælfthryth who married King Edgar after Æthelwald's death. William of Malmesbury's Gesta regum anglorum has a late account of Æthelwald's marriage and death. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter Ælfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent Æthelwald to see Ælfthryth, ordering him to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report.  When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, Æthelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this deception, and decided to repay Æthelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed Æthelwald. He asked Ælfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed Æthelwald during a hunt. Edward Augustus Freeman debunks the Æthelwald murder story as a tissue of romance in his Historic essays, but his arguments were in turn refuted by the naturalist William Henry Hudson in his 1920 book Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn. Æthelwald was seemingly dead by 962 as he ceases to witness charters at that time. He was buried at Ramsey Abbey. His younger brother Æthelwine succeeded to his offices. A memorial to Æthelwald, known as the Dead Man's Plack, was erected in Longparish, Hampshire in 1825.

He also wrote the screenplay based on Claus Pavels Riis's 1850 musical Til Sæters: dramatisk Idyl med Sange( To the Mountain Pastures: A Dramatic Idyll with Singing). The plot of the musical was very thin and mostly served as an excuse to link together various dance performances accompanied by well- known Norwegian folk melodies. Ivarson therefore added more people to the story and a little more intrigue, but retained the basic mood of the musical.

Fernando Ruiz de Castro( d. Bayonne, 1377), was a Galician nobleman of the House of Castro and prominent military figure. He was the third Count of Lemos, Trastámara and Sarria. He is often referred to by the appellation Toda la lealtad de España( All the loyalty of Spain), from an inscription on his tomb in Bayonne. He was the son of Pedro Fernández de Castro and Isabel Ponce de Leon. He was the brother of Juana de Castro, wife of King Peter I of Castile and half- brother of the controversial Inês de Castro( mistress of King Peter I of Portugal), and Álvaro Pires de Castro( leader of the Portuguese branch of the House of Castro). Fernando Ruiz de Castro became a prominent figure in the circle of King Peter of Castile, and served as lord steward and standard- bearer of the realm. During the Castilian Civil War, he was the leading partisan of Peter's camp, and continued fighting for the Petrist cause against the House of Trastámara even after the king's death in 1369. His first marriage in 1354 to Juana Alfonso, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso XI of Castile, produced two children: Divorced from his first wife, in 1367 he married Eleanor Enriquez, Lady of Melgar, widow of Alonso de Guzmán and daughter of Enrique Enriquez and his wife, Urraca Ponce de Leon. This marriage produced no offspring. From his mistress Mília Gonçalves, Lady of Assequins, he had one illegitimate son:

Fernando Rodríguez (or Fernán Ruiz) de Castro  (1125–1185) was a Castilian nobleman, statesman and military leader who made his career in León. He was the leader of the House of Castro during the civil wars that followed the death of Sancho III of Castile and the succession of the infant Alfonso VIII. He was nicknamed el Castellano (the Castilian) in León and el Leonés (the Leonese) in Castile. Fernando was the eldest son of Rodrigo Fernández de Castro and his wife, Eilo Álvarez. He led the Castro family in their dispute with the House of Lara over the custody and regency of the young Alfonso VIII after Sancho III's death in August 1158. Early in 1160 the Laras managed to exile him to the court of Ferdinand II of León. He returned to Castile in March with an army and defeated the Laras at the Battle of Lobregal, where his erstwhile father-in-law, Osorio Martínez, was killed fighting alongside his enemies, and Nuño Pérez de Lara was captured. Nonetheless, he was unable to reestablish himself in his homeland. Shortly after 1160, with a mixed force of Christians and Muslims, Fernando besieged the recently founded city of Ciudad Rodrigo. Ferdinand II, with the militias of Salamanca and Zamora, came to its relief. Fernando was soon reconciled to the king of León, who appointed him governor first of Cuéllar, Dueñas, Salamanca, Toro, Valladolid, and Zamora, and later of Asturias and Benavente. He served Ferdinand II as majordomo, the highest court official in power, on two occasions: between 15 August 1162 and 6 September 1164 and between 19 October 1165 and 15 May 1166. In 1162 Ferdinand II conquered Toledo from Castile and placed it in the hands of Fernando Rodríguez as governor. Toledo remained a Leonese possession until 1166. In 1164 Fernando returned to Castile a second time with an army and killed Manrique Pérez de Lara in the Battle of Huete (June/July). In 1168 he was appointed alcalde in the city of León, and controlled the city's fortifications (tenente turris Legionisheld the towers of León) until 1182. In the early summer of 1169, the Portuguese freebooter Gerald the Fearless took the city of Badajoz after a long siege, but the garrison took refuge in the alcazaba, the siege of which continued. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region at the expense of both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve Gerald. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of León, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison. Fernando Rodríguez, then majordomo, was one of the Leonese leaders on this expedition. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Fernando captured Gerald. After the mêlée the Leonese had control of the town and the alcazaba, which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom. Ferdinand retained Cáceres, but Trujillo, Montánchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfragüe he gave to Fernando Ruiz. Fernando thus established a semi-independent lordship between the Tagus and Guadiana rivers, with his seat at Trujillo. In 1171 he was granted the infantaticum of León. Between 1172 and 1175 Fernando held Mayorga and Melgar de Arriba from the Crown, both had been fiefs of Osorio Martínez. He was for the remainder of his career a frequent attendee at both the Leonese and Castilian courts. The Annales compostellani record Fernando's death in the year 1185, sometime after August 16.

Zakazane piosenki (Forbidden Songs) is a 1946 Polish musical film directed by Leonard Buczkowski. It was the first feature film to be created in Poland following the six years of World War II. The film, set during the German occupation of Warsaw during the war, tells the story of several inhabitants of the same tenement house. Their stories are loosely tied together by a set of songs, both pre-war ballads popular during the war and war-time popular songs mocking German occupation (Siekiera, motyka). The film's premiere took place on 8 January 1947 in the newly reopened cinema in Warsaw. The film proved to be highly popular and more than 10.8 million people watched it in the following three years - twice the usual average attendance in post-war Poland. In 1948 the film was re-edited and re-released in a new version, with more focus on Red Army's role as the liberator of Poland and the main ally of post-war Polish communist regime, as well as more grim outlook of the German occupation of Warsaw and German brutality in general. Main differences: However, as the farcical plot and all-familiar songs were mostly free of ideological subtexts, the film remained popular in the decades to come and some of its songs re-emerged in slightly modified form during the 1980s martial law and struggle against the Communist rule. The film remains well-known and popular even in modern Poland, being screened by the public Polish Television (TVP) on a regular basis. Both editions have been published on DVD in Poland, by the Propaganda label, first the 1947 one, as-is, and later the 1948 one, in a digitally restored version.

677,"Victor Civita (February 9, 1907 - August 24, 1990) was an Italian-Brazilian journalist and publisher. His family emigrated from Italy to New York in 1938 following passage of the Race Law. In 1949 Civita relocated his family to Brazil, where he established the publishing house Editora Abril in São Paulo, which developed into Grupo Abril, one of the largest publishing houses in the country.

Roberto F. Civita (9 August 1936 – 26 May 2013) was a Brazilian businessman and publisher. Born in Italy, he emigrated at the age of two with his family to New York in 1938 to escape effects of the Race Laws. They moved again to Brazil in 1949, where his father Victor Civita founded Editora Abril, a publishing house. After college and graduate school in the United States, the younger Civita entered the family business in the 1960s. He helped its expansion and development as Grupo Abril, becoming one of the largest publishing companies in Brazil. Beginning in 1982 he became president, and took over all operations in 1990. He became chairman of the Board of Directors and Editorial Head of Grupo Abril.

Comita II( or III)( died 1147) was the giudice of the Giudicato of Arborea, from 1131 until his death. He was the son of Constantine I of Arborea, first ruler of Arborea of the Lacon dynasty. Married Elena de Orrubu, mother of Barison II of Arborea. The dating and chronology of his reign are obscure. Comita succeeded his father Constantine I of Arborea. The date of this succession is assumed to be 1131, when he first appears in a communication with the Republic of Genoa. In 1130, Constantine, Gonario II of Torres, and Comita I of Gallura had sworn fealty to the archbishop of Pisa. In 1133, Pope Innocent II raised Genoa to archiepiscopal status and divided the island of Sardinia between the two sees, giving the north to Genoa and the south to Pisa. In the subsequent wars of that decade, Comita was the sole ally of the Genoese. From 1133 to 1145, there is a gap in the testimony referring to Comita and it is possible that his brother Torbeno successfully usurped his throne during a war with the Giudicato of Logudoro. In 1145, Comita was back in power and was excommunicated by Baldwin, Archbishop of Pisa. The Pisan prelate, travelling the island as a papal legate, had excommunicated the judge for oppressing the people and warring against Pisa. Bernard of Clairvaux even weighed into island politics and sent a letter to Pope Eugene III to justify Baldwin's actions. Nominally Arborea was transferred to Logudoro. Comita died soon after.

She was a sister of President of the United States John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy. Kennedy was intellectually disabled and was educated separately from other students; however, she was able to travel and to participate in social functions with her family. Kennedy was presented to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace in 1938. In her early young adult years, Kennedy experienced seizures and violent mood swings. In response to these and other difficulties, Kennedy's father arranged a prefrontal lobotomy for Kennedy in 1941 when she was 23 years of age. The procedure failed, leaving Kennedy permanently incapacitated and rendering her unable to speak intelligibly. Kennedy spent most of the rest of her life being cared for at St. Coletta, an institution in Jefferson, Wisconsin. The truth about her situation and whereabouts was kept secret for decades. While she was initially isolated from her relatives following her lobotomy, Kennedy visited with her family during her later life.

Kennedy grew up in Sandycove, Dublin, the middle child of three girls. Her father is John Kennedy who would later feature alongside his daughter as her pianist on The Lucy Kennedy Show.

Caroline Bouvier Kennedy (born November 27, 1957) is an American author, attorney, and diplomat who served as the United States Ambassador to Japan from 2013 to 2017.

Kennedy was five days shy of her sixth birthday when her father was assassinated on November 22, 1963. The following year, Caroline, her mother, and brother John F. Kennedy Jr. settled on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where she attended school. Kennedy graduated from Radcliffe College and worked at Manhattan's Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she met her future husband, exhibit designer Edwin Schlossberg. She went on to receive a J.D. degree from Columbia Law School. Most of Kennedy's professional life has spanned law and politics, as well as education reform and charitable work. She has also acted as a spokesperson for her family's legacy and co-authored two books with Ellen Aldermanon on civil liberties. Early in the primary race for the 2008 presidential election, Kennedy and her uncle Ted endorsed Democratic candidate Barack Obama; she later stumped for him in Florida, Indiana, and Ohio, served as co-chair of his Vice Presidential Search Committee, and addressed the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. After Obama selected United States Senator Hillary Clinton to serve as Secretary of State, Kennedy expressed interest in being appointed to Clinton's vacant Senate seat from New York, but she later withdrew from consideration, citing personal reasons.  Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand ultimately replaced Clinton as the junior New York Senator. In 2013, President Obama appointed Kennedy as the United States Ambassador to Japan.

Half Mile Lagoon once covered an area of 36000 square metres, however the largest of the remaining pools was only approximately 100 square metres( when surveyed in 2005). This area is an example of decreasing water levels which have impacted on many of the smaller dune lakes on the Aupouri Pensinsula. Half Mile Lagoon lies directly adjacent to the Aupouri pine forest, and much of the catchment land use is pastoral.

Lake Waitaki is the smallest, oldest and farthest downstream of the three man-made lakes of the Waitaki hydroelectric project in New Zealand's South Island.

Lake Waikareiti, also spelt Lake Waikare Iti, is located in Te Urewera National Park in the North Island of New Zealand. A number of hiking trails are found within the catchment basin of the lake. Its formation followed a landslide 18,000 years ago, in which a part of the landmass of 10 kilometers wide slid to the north- west. It is four kilometres to the northeast of the larger Lake Waikaremoana, into which it drains via the Aniwaniwa Stream. The smaller lake's surface is at an altitude of 880 metres above sea level- considerably higher than that of Waikaremoana- and as such the stream has several fine waterfalls such as the Aniwaniwa Falls and Mokau Falls. Several small islets are found in the lake. One of these, Rahui, itself contains a tiny lake- one of New Zealand's very rare lakes within lakes. Numerous flora species are found within the lake catchment basin, crown fern( Blechnum discolor) being a widespread understory plant. An assortment of birds found in the North Island are present at the national park except for the weka.

Baekje's commercial positions along the Yellow Sea coast were now dominated by Goguryeo, trading outposts in China were lost to the Sui Dynasty's unification, and Japan's political centralization outgrew Baekje's influence as well. The decline of external commerce and influence led to infighting among the nobility. He was succeeded by his son Beop.

Wideok of Baekje (525–598) (r. 554–598) was the 27th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the eldest son of King Seong, and rose to the throne upon his father's death.

Alex Lozupone is a New York City – based jazz and rock musician and film director. As a musician, he is a member of Marc Edwards& Slipstream Time Travel, and has played with Percy Jones and Stephen Moses. As a director and cinematographer, he shoots mainly music shows in New York City, and has put up videos for artists such as Pet Bottle Ningen, Weasel Walter, Gato Loco, 24- 7 Spyz, and Melvin Van Peebles, as well as readings by Samuel Delany. He has also received airplay on WFMU. In 2011, he released the first video associating the Occupy Wall Street movement with the Melvin Van Peebles song, Love, That's America. The video spawned several imitators. In 2012, he recorded and mixed Melvin Van Peebles' first album in 17 years, Nahh … Nahh Mofo. He then shot and edited, with Van Peebles, a video to accompany the album for Lilly Done The Zampoughi Every Time I Pulled Her Coattail. Also in 2012 he joined Marc Edwards& Slipstream Time Travel, performing at a fundraiser at the Cotton Club. In 2013 he recorded and performed on two tracks on a benefit album for Donovan Drayton, which also featured Ronny Drayton, Paula Henderson, Jimi Hazel, and Burnt Sugar. He also recorded and played on a release by Marc Edwards called Holographic Projection Holograms, an album which Steve Holtje listed as# 12 in his Favorite Jazz albums of 2013. Holtje particularly praised Lozupone's configuration of splitting his guitar signal and routing it signal through a processor and bass amp, creating both a guitar and bass track. In 2014, he released a CD under the group name Eighty- Pound Pug, with David Tamura and Paul Feitzinger. Bruce Gallanter of Downtown Music Gallery says of the CD, Right from that opening salvo, this trio is powerful and impressive. Mr. Lozupone sounds as if he is playing some dark, metalish, heavy guitar with Mr. Tamura's sax also erupting intensely and Feitzinger strong drumming holding things together. Scary, punk/ metal/ free/ jazz improv ?!? Lozupoane does a fine job of playing powerful riffs, helping to keep the trio focused into a fire- breathing bohemeth. He uses effects likea wah- wah or distortion to fatten his sound into a more throbbing mass. Torture time? Indeed. In 2015, he released, with poet Steve Dalachinsky, Leave The Door Open; Steve Holtje of Culture Catch said of this album Dalachinsky's self- deprecating Brooklyn humor and existentialist beat musings, more usually accompanied by free jazz, prove highly compatible with this doomier sound keyed on Lozupone's electronically combined bass and guitar. Really, what better to accompany a 9/11 poem that starts, I thought it was the end of the world/ And then the end of the world happened again.

The melody of the song was composed by Don Felder in a rented house on Malibu Beach. He recorded the basic tracks with a Rhythm Ace drum machine and added a 12 string guitar on a four - track recording deck in his spare bedroom, then mixed in a bassline, and gave Don Henley and Glenn Frey each a copy of the recording. Felder, who met the Eagles through his high school bandmate Bernie Leadon, said that Leadon advised him to make tapes of songs he wrote for the band so that other band members like Henley, whose forte is in writing lyrics, might work with him on finishing the songs they like. The demos he made were always instrumental, and on every album project he would submit 15 or 16 ideas. The demo he made for ``Hotel California ''showed influences from Latin and reggae music, and it grabbed the attention of Henley who said he liked the song that`` sounds like a Mexican reggae or Bolero'', which gave the song its first working title, ``Mexican Reggae ''.

Fabulous Trobadors are a band from Toulouse, France, founded in 1987. They have developed their own distinctive style based on Occitan folk music and the rhythms of northeastern Brazil. Claude Sicre writes the lyrics and raps, while Ange B( real name Jean- Marc Enjalbert) raps and acts as a human beatbox, producing a wide range of sounds( beats, scratches, trumpet, guitar etc.) solely with his mouth. Their first album, Èra pas de faire( In English, We should n't have done it), was released on Massilia Sound System's Roker Promocion label. Originally the lyrics to their songs were in the Occitan language, but they have since reached a wider audience with French- language lyrics. They are noted for their political engagement, denouncing politicians such as Toulouse mayor Dominique Baudis, and particularly for their humour, wordplay, and constant puns. A major feature of their concerts is improvisation in the form of rap battles, verbal duels between the two rappers with each trying to outdo the other. These joutes verbales or duels de tchaches, as the band calls them, are inspired by the tenson of Occitan troubadours. The auditorium also forms part of the show, with numerous folk dances taking place. The Fabulous Trobadors engage in their songs with the defence of cultural( notably Occitan) identity, decentralisation, and the fight against economic neoliberalism. Together with other artists they have promoted the idea of the Linha Imaginòt, an imaginary line linking like- minded people, towns and villages, a symbol of a movement towards greater cultural democracy.

All recount essentially the same passage, given by the last two as follows: There were three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest, and Mary his wife, under the reign of Cleopatra and Sosipatrus, before the reign of Herod, the son of Antipater: the eldest was Mary, the second was Sobe, the youngest's name was Anne. The eldest being married in Bethlehem, had for daughter Salome the midwife; Sobe the second likewise married in Bethlehem, and was the mother of Elizabeth; last of all the third married in Galilee, and brought forth Mary the mother of Christ. The 19th- century mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich claims that according to her visions( which give a detailed genealogy of Mary), Sobe was a sister of Anne, but the mother of Elizabeth was Emerentia, Sobe and Anne's maternal aunt.

Eleanor Pery, daughter of William Pery, 1st Baron Glentworth. He was educated at Harrow School, where he was a childhood friend of Lord Byron, and Trinity College, Dublin. He married Mary Spring Rice, the daughter of Stephen Edward Rice and Catherine Spring, and sister of Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon, in 1807. He succeeded to his father's title in 1818. The Hunt/de Vere family estate for 300 years (1657–1957), including the period of the de Vere Baronetcy of Curragh, is the present day Curraghchase Forest Park, in County Limerick. De Vere spent most of his life on the estate and was closely involved in its management. He suffered much trouble from his ownership of the island of Lundy, which his father, who was not much of a businessman, had unwisely purchased in 1802, and which became a heavy drain on the family's finances. Sir Vere was never able to find a purchaser for Lundy, and it took his son until 1834 to dispose of it. Sir Aubrey stood for election in the 1820 General Election and came in third with 2921 votes. He changed his surname from Hunt to de Vere in 1832, in reference to his Earl of Oxford ancestors, dating back to Aubrey de Vere I, a tenant-in-chief in England of William the Conqueror in 1086. He served as High Sheriff of County Limerick in 1811. Sir Aubrey was a poet. Wordsworth called his sonnets the most perfect of the age. These and his drama, Mary Tudor: An Historical Drama, were published by his son the poet Mr. Aubrey Thomas de Vere in 1875 and 1884.

Robert de Vere( after c. 1165 – before 25 October 1221), hereditary Master Chamberlain of England, was son of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, and Agnes of Essex. He succeeded his brother as the third Earl of Oxford, and was one of the twenty- five guarantors of Magna Carta. Robert de Vere was the second surviving son of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, and his third wife, Agnes of Essex. The date of his birth is not known, but he was likely born after 1164. Almost nothing is known of his life until 1207, when he married Isabel de Bolebec, the widow of Henry de Nonant( d.1206) of Totnes, Devon. In 1206- 7 Isabel and her sister Constance were co-heiresses of their niece, another Isabel de Bolebec, the countess of Oxford by her marriage to Robert's brother, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford. They divided the barony of Whitchurch. The fact that aunt and niece had identical names, Isabel de Bolbec, and were successively countesses of Oxford and heiresses of Whitchurch has led to confusion between the two women. When Robert's brother, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford, died in the latter half of 1214, Robert succeeded to his title and estates and the hereditary office of Master Chamberlain of England. The dower of Earl Aubrey's second wife, Alice( possibly his cousin, a daughter of Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk), had not been formalized. In 1215 Oxford settled his sister- in- law's dower by lot, the earl drawing two knights' fees for every one drawn by Alice. This is the only known instance of dower being settled in this manner. Oxford joined the disaffected barons who met at Stamford and forced King John to issue Magna Carta at Runnymede on 15 June 1215. The earl was elected one of the barons who were to guarantee the King's adherence to its terms. Together with other Magna Carta barons, he was excommunicated as a rebel by Pope Innocent III on 16 December 1215, and joined them in offering the crown to Prince Louis of France. Oxford took up arms against King John, but pledged loyalty to him after the King had taken Castle Hedingham in March 1216. Later in the same year, however, he did homage to Prince Louis at Rochester. Louis entered London and was proclaimed King. On 14 June 1216, he captured Winchester and soon controlled over half of England. In the midst of this crisis, King John died, prompting many of the barons to desert Louis in favor of John's nine- year- old son, Henry III. In 1217 Prince Louis retook Castle Hedingham and restored it to Oxford, but despite this Oxford transferred his allegiance to the new King in October 1217. Although he did homage to Henry, he was not fully restored in his offices and lands until February 1218. Earl Robert served as a king's justice in 1220- 21, and died shortly before 25 October 1221. He was buried at Hatfield Regis Priory, where either his son, Hugh de Vere, 4th Earl of Oxford, or his grandson, Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford had an effigy erected in which he is depicted in chain mail, cross- legged, pulling his sword from its scabbard and holding a shield displaying his de Vere arms.

788,"The Last House on the Beach( Italian: La settima donna, also known as Terror and The Seventh Woman) is a 1978 Italian rape and revenge- thriller film directed by Franco Prosperi. The American title refers to Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left, and Alexandra Heller- Nicholas stated how combining the nunsploitation subgenre with rape- revenge, the film deviates plot- wise from The Last House on the Left substantially, but arrives at a similar ethical conclusion. It was argued that the final scene of the movie inspired the final scene in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.

Last House on Dead End Street, originally released as The Fun House, is a 1977 American exploitation horror film written, produced, and directed by Roger Watkins, under the pseudonym Victor Janos. The plot follows a disgruntled ex-convict( also played by Watkins) who takes revenge on society by kidnapping four acquaintances and filming their murders in an abandoned building. Watkins, a student at the State University of New York at Oneonta, devised the concept for the film after reading the Charles Manson biography The Family( 1971) by Ed Sanders. Commissioning a cast from the university's theater department, Watkins shot the film inside an unused building on the university campus in the winter of 1972, on a budget of around$ 3,000. Screened under the title The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell at the 1973 Cannes and Berlin Film Festivals, Watkins's original cut of the film( now lost) ran approximately three hours in length. A truncated version of the film was released theatrically in 1977 under the title The Fun House. In 1979, Cinematic Releasing Corporation acquired distribution rights to the film and re-released it under the title Last House on Dead End Street, capitalizing on the popularity of Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left. In the decades following its release, Last House on Dead End Street was subject to various rumors about who had created and starred in it, as the entire cast and crew were credited using pseudonyms. This resulted in speculation that the film might have depicted actual murders. In 2000, Watkins publicly came forward and confirmed himself as the director, writer, and lead actor. Two years later, the film was released for the first time on DVD, through participation from Watkins, and with the actual names of the actors revealed. The film has continued to be a point of discussion among film scholars, largely due to its metafilmic qualities, surrealist imagery, and themes surrounding the aestheticization of violence in cinema.

The Last House on the Left is a 1972 American exploitation horror film written, edited, and directed by Wes Craven and produced by Sean S. Cunningham. The film stars Sandra Peabody, Lucy Grantham, David A. Hess, Fred Lincoln, Jeramie Rain, and Marc Sheffler. The plot revolves around two teenage girls who are taken into the woods and tortured by a gang of murderous thugs. The story is inspired by the Swedish film The Virgin Spring( 1960), directed by Ingmar Bergman, which in turn is based on a Swedish ballad, Töres döttrar i Wänge. Craven's directorial debut, the film was made on a modest budget of$ 87,000, and was filmed in New York City and rural Connecticut in 1971. It was released theatrically in the United States on August 30, 1972, and was a major box office success, grossing over$ 3 million domestically. Although its confrontational violence resulted in it being heavily censored and sometimes banned in other countries, the film was generally well received by critics.

Trenchard-Smith says making the movie was one of his craziest directing experiences:All directors, at some point in their career trajectory, find themselves hanging on to a runaway train; despite best efforts, things turn to custard on a daily basis. More often than not, The Movie from Hell is a co-production. Foreign locale, fast money, giant egos, high pressure schedule – all make a volatile witches’ brew, even before you factor in deep rooted national resentments. A co-production is a business model designed to diminish trust between nations. [On this film] Mexico, Spain, and the US were the partners, which meant that the Spaniards felt superior to their Mexican brothers, and the Americans felt superior to everybody. Each country gave undertakings to deliver certain elements of cast or crew. Disputes arose immediately. The American director bailed when his deposit failed to arrive. His agent, who was also mine, immediately slotted me in there, so within a day, the American producers, unbeknownst to me, offered their partners a replacement director: “the man who made the last Bruce Lee movie. ” I had in fact made a documentary about the late Bruce Lee, “The World of Kung Fu.” The Mexicans thought they were getting Enter the Dragon director, Robert Clouse.

Who is the maternal grandfather of Agnès Of Navarre?",king charles iii of navarre,louis x of france,0.29203468561172485,0.1506401849870651,False
805,"Agnès of Navarre( 1334 – 1396) was the daughter of Philip III of Navarre and Joan II of Navarre, and became Countess of Foix on marriage to Gaston III, Count of Foix. She was rumoured to have had an affair with poet Guillaume de Machaut and so inspired his poem Le Voir Dit.

Gaston IV (27 November 1422 – 25 or 28 July 1472) was the sovereign Viscount of Béarn and the Count of Foix and Bigorre in France from 1436 to 1472. He also held the viscounties of Marsan, Castelbon, Nébouzan, Villemeur and Lautrec and was, by virtue of the county of Foix, co-prince of Andorra. From 1447 he was also Viscount of Narbonne. Through his marriage to Eleonor, heiress of the Kingdom of Navarre, he also held the title of Prince of Navarre. He was a son of John I, Count of Foix and Jeanne d'Albret. His maternal grandparents were Charles d'Albret, Constable of France and co-commander of the French army, killed at the Battle of Agincourt, and his wife Marie de Sully. Gaston married the Navarrese Infanta, Eleonor, in 1436. Her parents were John II of Aragon and Blanche I of Navarre. At the time, Leonor appeared to have few prospects: her father was a younger son and brother of kings of Aragon, and Leonor had a brother, Charles of Viana, and an older sister, Blanca, standing between herself and the throne of Navarre. However, family dissent and death eliminated both Charles and Blanca; Leonor's father usurped the Navarrese crown, to which he added in 1458 the throne of Aragon (his older brother having died without legitimate children) and, following the deaths of Charles and Blanca, promised the succession to Navarre to Leonor and her husband in return for their loyalty to him, which was given. They had ten children:

Aimery II (or Aimeric II) (died 17 July 1134) was the Viscount of Narbonne from around 1106 until his death. He was the eldest son of Aimery I of Narbonne and Mahalt (also Mahault or Mafalda), daughter of Robert Guiscard and Sichelgaita and widow of Raymond Berengar II of Barcelona. This made him a half-brother of Raymond Berengar III. He initially ruled as a minor under the regency of his mother. After he came of age he married Ermengard. Probably in 1112 or 1113, Aimery received the Fenouillèdes and the Peyrepertusès from his half-brother in return for swearing an oath of fealty against Bernard Ato IV of Béziers, with whom Raymond Berengar was at war. The lords of the Fenouillèdes and the Peyrepertuseès remained vassals of Narbonne until the Albigensian Crusade and the viscounts of Narbonne took the lordship of Rouffiac near Peyrepertuse into their own hands. When Douce I, Countess of Provence died and Raymond Berengar claimed the County of Provence, Aimery received the fief of Beaucaire and the terre d'Argence near the mouth of the Rhône in Provence. Sometime during his rule, Aimery granted the merchants of Narbonne the right to form a consulate in imitation of Genoa. Probably he saw the self-organisation of his merchants and their formation of a military in their own defence as an aid to his own rule so long as the consulate remained under vicecomital control, which in the end it did not. Aimery also participated in 1114–15 in the Balearic Islands expedition led by the Republic of Pisa and Raymond Berengar. In 1114, Aimery put an end to conflicting claims in the village of Le Lac on the Via Domitia by transferring his rights there to the abbey of Lagrasse in return for a large loan of gold and silver. He also entered into a conflict with his cousin Richard de Millau, Archbishop of Narbonne, who may have been a compromise candidate between Aimery and the pope for the archiepiscopal throne. Richard claimed that Aimery fecit mihi hominium propriis manibusdid homage to [him] with his own hands) received fedoviafiefs) from the Church in the presence of the universal synod of the province of Narbonne.  The archbishop accused Aimery of deceiving him concerning the extent of the Church's fiefs and attempting to hold land as his by inheritance which was his by grant of the Church; he also accused Aimery of withholding revenues from taxes and imposts that should have gone to the Church. Aimery was recorded to have even abused church property violently and there were disputes concerning who controlled the towers on the city walls. The whole dispute lasted a long time, but Aimery was made to come to terms by the Papacy's support of Richard. In the end, he had to swear oaths of fealty to the archbishop, recognise the archbishop's independent temporal lordship, and concede that some of the rights he held in the city of Narbonne constituted a fief of the archbishopric. In 1124, Bernard Ato of Béziers declared war on Aimery, who responded by razing the castle (pro justiciaout of justice) at Montséret, which had been held by Aimery's vassal Bernard Amati until he had treacherously turned it over to Bernard Ato. Not long after this Aimery turned towards Iberia and joined the Reconquista being waged by Alfonso the Battler in the Ebro valley. In July 1131, Aimery was at the deathbed of his half-brother to witness his final testament, of which he was to be the executor. Aimery died in battle before the walls of the Moorish city of Fraga, which Alfonso had been besieging. Aimery had a son and a daughter by Ermengard; the son, Aimery, predeceased him (ca. 1130), and he was succeeded by his daughter Ermengard, who was only four or five at the time. He married a second time to a woman named Ermessende and left by her a daughter of the same name. This second daughter, Ermessende, married before 1153 a great Castilian magnate, Manrique Pérez de Lara, lord of Molina.

From 1599 onward, he was forced to deal with a Lan Xang backed rebellion in Nan, and a Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai and Chiang Saen. He defeated the Chiang Rai rebellion in 1601–02 but was eventually forced to submit to Siam soon after. He defeated an invasion by Lan Xang in 1602–03, regaining Nan in the process.

Georgina del Carmen Weber Aliaga (21 February 1941 in Valdivia – August 8, 2007 in Concón) was the first wife of Chilean ex-president Ricardo Lagos and mother of politician Ricardo Lagos Weber. Carmen Weber met and married Ricardo Lagos in 1961, with whom he had two children: Ricardo and Ximena. After Lagos obtained his Ph.D. in the U.S., he annulled this marriage in 1969 (divorce was not legal in Chile until 2004.) He also obtained custody of his two children. The cause of the rupture was her severe bipolar disorder. She became famous during the run-up to the 1988 national plebiscite when she supported General Augusto Pinochet, and spoke negatively of her former husband during an interview that was aired on September 30 of that year. That interview was considered the single most damaging moment against the Pinochet option as Chileans perceived her as vindictive and bitter, and sympathy went to the husband rather than her. As a consequence of an accidental fire at her home on May 18, 2007, she suffered deep respiratory damage which eventually resulted in her serious injury. She died at her home in the city of Concón.

836,"Edward Ellsworth Annis (born February 2, 1980) is a Canadian professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Teddy Hart. He currently wrestles on the independent circuit. He most recently wrestled on a National scale for Major League Wrestling (MLW) as the leader of The Hart Foundation, where he was the longest reigning MLW World Middleweight Champion and also held the MLW World Tag Team Championship. He has also wrestled for AAA, the short-lived Wrestling Society X, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, and Dragon Gate USA. He operates a wrestling school in Edmonton. He is the son of Georgia Hart of the Hart family and wrestler B.J. Annis. Hart achieved an early degree of fame when he became the youngest wrestler to be signed to the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE). His subsequent release and controversial actions while wrestling on the independent circuit have earned him a measure of infamy. Outside of the ring Annis has been a mentor to several young wrestlers and has been a trainer at wrestling schools. Among his trainees are Jack Evans, Pete Wilson and his younger cousin Matt Hart. Annis is also a cat lover and breeder of Persian cats which he has used sometimes in storylines and brought with him to matches.

Theodore Jonathan Hart( May 7, 1816- May 28, 1887) was a Canadian businessman from Montreal, Lower Canada. He was the son of Benjamin Hart and grandson of Aaron Hart.

Stewart Edward Hart, (May 3, 1915 – October 16, 2003) was a Canadian professional wrestler, wrestling booker, promoter, coach and trainer, football player, amateur wrestler, and sailor. He is best known for founding and handling Stampede Wrestling, a professional wrestling promotion based in Calgary, Alberta, teaching many individuals at its associated wrestling school The Dungeon and establishing a professional wrestling dynasty consisting of his relatives and close trainees. As the patriarch of the Hart wrestling family, Hart is the ancestor of many wrestlers, most notably being the father of Bret and Owen Hart as well as the grandfather of Natalya Neidhart, Teddy Hart and David Hart Smith. Hart was born to a poor Saskatchewan family but became a successful amateur wrestler during the 1930s and early 1940s, holding many national championships, as well as engaging in many other sports. He began wrestling for show in 1943 with the Royal Canadian Navy while serving in World War II as he could not go to the 1940 Summer Olympics due to the war. After leaving the service he travelled to America and debuted professionally for the New York wrestling territory in 1946. Hart was considered very handsome and a good in-ring performer, focusing on a submission-like and technical style of wrestling, but despite this and being popular in general he was not given a major spotlight by the writers, and soon after marrying Helen Smith, whom he met in New York City, he created his own promotion in Edmonton, Alberta which would be known as Stampede Wrestling and took over the surrounding wrestling territory which covered most of western Canada and the US state of Montana. The territory would go on to become known as the Stampede territory thenceforth. In 1949, Stu and Helen moved to Great Falls, Montana. Hart's promotion featured a large variety of outside stars from the wrestling industry as well as homegrown talent for whom he booked storylines. Beginning from the 1950s Hart helped train a large number of people for his company and gained a reputation as one of the best teachers in the wrestling business. In October 1951, Stu and Helen moved to Calgary, Alberta, into what would become the famous Hart House. Hart remained an active full-time wrestler until the 1960s when he entered semi-in-ring retirement, thereafter he would focus mostly on promoting, booking and teaching, as well as raising his twelve children with Helen while still appearing in the ring sporadically until the 1980s. Throughout his career, Hart almost exclusively portrayed a heroic character, a so-called babyface role and only held one professional title, the NWA Northwest Tag Team Championship. After selling his territory to Titan Sports, Inc. in 1984, Hart would make several appearances on WWF television and Pay-Per-View with his wife, often involved in storylines surrounding his sons Bret and Owen and several of his sons-in-law who were signed to the company. He continued to teach wrestling at his home in Calgary until the 1990s when he suffered a severe leg injury and had to stop engaging excessively with students, leaving most of the work for his sons Bruce and Keith. He died at age 88 in October 2003 after suffering from multiple medical issues. Hart is regarded by many, including major wrestling historian and sports journalist Dave Meltzer, as one of the most influential and important figures in professional wrestling history and an icon of the artform. His greatest contribution to the art was as a promoter and trainer. Along with Bret and Owen, Hart's trainees included future world champions Fritz Von Erich, Superstar Billy Graham, Chris Jericho, Edge, Christian, Mark Henry, Chris Benoit, and Jushin Thunder Liger. Hart was a member of the inaugural Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame class in 1996 and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2010 by his son Bret. Hart was also well known for his involvement in over thirty charities, for which he was named a Member of the Order of Canada, the second highest honour for merit which can be given in Canada and the highest civilian honour.

After leaving Bishop Creighton School, he became a clerk on the London and North Western Railway, he joined the Foot Guards when the First World War broke out, later transferring to the Royal Artillery. He was wounded and invalided home, where army doctors advised him to find a more active occupation than his previous office job in order to improve his health.

In 1930, he was given the job of organising the workers on the company's new Green Line services throughout London and the Home counties and two years later he became a full- time union officer as Outer London Passenger Organiser. In 1940 he became the Area Organiser of Area No.1( London and South East). He also served for seven years as chairman of the London Trades Council, struggling in vain against its domination by Communists( which eventually led to its disbandment by the Trades Union Congress( TUC)), and for four years as chairman of the London Labour Party. During the Second World War he commanded a Home Guard battalion and was TUC representative on the Territorial Army Advisory Committee. In 1948, he was appointed assistant general secretary of the TGWU in succession to Harold Clay. In 1949, he was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire( OBE) in 1951. In 1955, while elections were underway for his successor, general secretary Arthur Deakin died suddenly and Tiffin took over as acting general secretary. Later that year he was officially elected to the post, beating Charles Brandon, who had previously been his superior as area secretary of Area No.1, as well as Frank Cousins, Tom Hodgson, Harry Nicholas, and Bill Tudor. Three or four months after taking office Tiffin became seriously ill and died after just over six months as general secretary. He was succeeded by Frank Cousins, who had replaced him as assistant general secretary and acted as general secretary during his illness. Tiffin's short period of office was troubled by a dock strike and a dispute between the TGWU and the National Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers.

In 1935, he was awarded the Heywood prize for the design of reinforced concrete flats. The following year he was awarded the third prize in a competition for a new Rhodesian Parliament; the prize money, £ 250, was enough to enable him to start his own practice. Grenfell- Baines's work for the Air Ministry during World War II brought him to the attention of Anthony Chitty and the London Modernists. Although Grenfell- Baines always chose to be based in Preston, he cultivated friendships in national and international circles. In 1951, he was invited to design a pavilion for the Festival of Britain. Grenfell- Baines's post-war work included the New Towns of Newton Aycliffe( planned 1947) and Peterlee( planned 1948). An abiding interest for GG was multidisciplinary working. His highly successful firm BDP( Building Design Partnership) was the result of numerous experiments in management structure. In 1972, he became professor of Architecture at Sheffield University where he founded the Design Teaching Partnership. He officially retired in 1974 but continued working as a consultant into his final decade. He received an OBE in 1960 and was knighted in 1978. Grenfell- Baines was survived by his second wife, Milena Fleischmann, whom he married in 1954, their son and daughter, and the two daughters of his first marriage, to Dorothy Hodson. Milena was a Czech refugee of the Kindertransport. National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview( C467/46) with George Grenfell- Baines in 2000 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.

For a time he was considered his father's heir, but that changed after his mother's downfall in 48, when it was revealed she had engaged in a bigamous marriage without Claudius' knowledge. The next year, his father married Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' fourth and final marriage. Their marriage was followed by the adoption of Agrippina's son, Lucius Domitius, whose name became Nero as a result. His step- brother would later be married to his sister Octavia, and soon eclipsed him as Claudius' heir. Following his father's death in October 54, Nero became emperor.

Germanicus (Latin: Germanicus Julius Caesar; 24 May 15 BC – 10 October AD 19) was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and a prominent general of the Roman Empire, who was known for his campaigns in Germania. The son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, Germanicus was born into an influential branch of the patrician gens Claudia. The agnomen Germanicus was added to his full name in 9 BC when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honor of his victories in Germania. In AD 4, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, Tiberius, who succeeded Augustus as Roman emperor a decade later. As a result, Germanicus became an official member of the gens Julia, another prominent family which he was related to on his mother's side. His connection to the Julii was further consolidated through a marriage between himself and Agrippina the Elder, a granddaughter of Augustus. He was also the nephew of Tiberius, the older brother of Claudius, the father of Caligula, and the maternal grandfather of Nero. During the reign of Augustus, Germanicus enjoyed an accelerated political career as the heir of the emperor's heir, entering the office of quaestor five years before the legal age in AD 7. He held that office until AD 11, and was elected consul for the first time in AD 12. The year after, he was made proconsul of Germania Inferior, Germania Superior, and all of Gaul. From there he commanded eight legions, about one-third of the entire Roman army, which he led against the Germanic tribes in his campaigns from AD 14 to 16. He avenged the Roman Empire's defeat in the Teutoburg Forest and retrieved two of the three legionary eagles that had been lost during the battle. In AD 17 he returned to Rome where he received a triumph before leaving to reorganize the provinces of Asia Minor, whereby he incorporated the provinces of Cappadocia and Commagene in AD 18. While in the eastern provinces, he came into conflict with the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. During their feud, Germanicus became ill in Antioch, where he died on 10 October AD 19. His death has been attributed to poison by ancient sources, but that was never proven. As a famous general, he was widely popular and regarded as the ideal Roman long after his death. To the Roman people, Germanicus was the Roman equivalent of Alexander the Great due to the nature of his death at a young age, his virtuous character, his dashing physique, and his military renown.

Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, where her originality and talent were quickly spotted by the troupe leader, Marie Savitch. This led to a lifelong bond and common research between the two women. In 1948, she was asked to return to England to take over the eurythmy school of Vera and Judy Compton- Burnett, where she came to know and work closely with Owen Barfield and Cecil Harwood, whom she married in 1953.

For many years she taught and performed with the London School of Eurythmy, which she directed, and the London Stage Group. The work took her regularly to Scandinavia, North America and South Africa, where she did much to assist the development of eurythmy.

She died in August 1983. The book Eurythmy and the Impulse of Dance written together with Cecil Harwood and Marjorie Raffé, records her research into the principles of eurythmy in English.

It grossed$ 49.4 million at the box office on a budget of$ 13 million, which made it the highest- grossing film in the franchise until the release of Freddy vs. Jason, a crossover with the Friday the 13th film series, in 2003.

A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 2010 American slasher film directed by Samuel Bayer, and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer. The film stars Jackie Earle Haley, Kyle Gallner, Rooney Mara, Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz. It is a remake of Wes Craven's 1984 film of the same name. Produced by Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes, the film was designed to reboot the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and is the ninth installment in the series. The film is set in a fictitious town of Ohio and centers around a group of teenagers living on one street who are stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named Freddy Krueger. The teenagers discover that they all share a common link from their childhood that makes them targets for Krueger. In January 2008, Variety reported that Bay and his Platinum Dunes production company would be rebooting the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise with a remake of the original 1984 film.  A Nightmare on Elm Street was originally to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, where the writers took the best elements from each of the films in the original series and created a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline but tried to create a scarier film. To that end, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring back his darker nature. The writers developed the character to be a child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead. Freddy's physical appearance was changed with the use of computer-generated imagery to be closer to that of a burn victim. Because of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes' producers had in the area, A Nightmare on Elm Street was filmed primarily in Illinois. Craven expressed his displeasure when he was not consulted on the project. Robert Englund, who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy. A Nightmare on Elm Street was produced by New Line Cinema and had its world premiere at Hollywood on April 27, 2010, and was theatrically released in North America on April 30, 2010, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the teenage characters and story while offering some praise for Bayer's direction and Haley's performance. Regardless, A Nightmare on Elm Street broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film and grossed more in its opening weekend than the total gross of four other Nightmare on Elm Street films. The film earned over $63 million at the domestic box office and over $115 million worldwide.

He inherited the immediate lordship of Gemen in 1675, being 18 years after the death of his father during which the regency on Gemen was exercised by his mother Isabella countess von Vehlen und Meggen zu Raesfeld. The reason for the regency is not known. On 15 September 1700, a decision by the Courts confirmed its succession right over Gemen.

Wichmann II the Younger (also spelled Wigmann or Wichman) (about 930 - 22 September 967) was a member of the Saxon House of Billung. He was a son of Count Wichmann the Elder and his wife Frederuna, probably a sister of Queen Matilda. The cousin of Emperor Otto I became known as a fierce enemy of the ruling Ottonian dynasty. Wichmann was perhaps born at present-day Wichmannsburg, part of Bienenbüttel, at the residence of his father. Wichmann I the Elder, though the first-born of three Billung brothers and by his marriage related to King Otto I, was ignored at the enfeoffment with the Saxon Billung March, which in 936 fell to his younger brother Hermann. Wichmann the Elder at first rebelled against the king, joining the uprising of Duke Eberhard of Franconia, but gave up soon afterwards. Upon his father's death in 944, Wichmann the Younger remained under the tutelage of his uncle Hermann. When he came of age, he was only able to succeed to the rank of a count in Angria, though his county is unknown. Raised at the court of King Otto I upon the early death of their mother, Wichmann made friends with the king's son Liudolf, duke of Swabia since 950. In 953 he participated in Liudolf's rebellion against King Otto, fighting the Saxon troops during the king's siege of Mainz, whereby he re-opened his father's feud with Hermann, his uncle, who meanwhile had been appointed princeps of Saxony. Wichmann was captured; Otto prevented him from being punished more severely, contrary to Hermann's wishes. He was released in 954, though he was not included in the general settlement that followed the revolt. Wichmann and his brother Egbert the One-Eyed, still feeling deprived of their heritage, marauded through Saxony and in 955 arrived in the lands of the Slavic Obotrites at Liubice (Lübeck), where they instigated a revolt under Prince Nako that was suppressed by King Otto at the Battle of Recknitz. The young Billungs fled to the court of Duke Hugh the Great of France. When Hugh died the next year, Wichmann had to return to Germany; he was however pardoned after he had sworn loyalty to King Otto. He remained an implacable opponent, attacking the lands of his uncle Hermann several times, until he had to retreat to the Slavic Lutici territories, where he was tolerated by Margrave Gero. In 963, Wichmann was an outlaw leading a band of West Slavs (likely Pomeranians) in battle against Duke Mieszko I of Poland, defeating him twice and even exacting tribute. For a brief interlude, he was allowed to return to Germany and his wife's estates, but he was exiled once more by his uncle Hermann during Otto's second Italian campaign. In 967, he and the western Pomeranians were defeated at Wolin by an alliance of Mieszko and Duke Boleslaus I of Bohemia and Wichmann was killed in action. Wichmann's lands were confiscated by Otto and divided in two, half going to the monastery of Saint Michael founded by Hermann Billung at Lüneburg, and half going to found the convent of Keminada (near Bodenwerder) on the Weser.

992,"Louis Antoine of France, Duke of Angoulême (6 August 1775 – 3 June 1844) was the elder son of Charles X of France and the last Dauphin of France from 1824 to 1830. He was technically King of France and Navarre for less than 20 minutes before he himself abdicated, due to his father's abdication during the July Revolution in 1830. He never reigned over the country, but after his father's death in 1836, he was the legitimist pretender as Louis XIX. He was a petit-fils de France at birth, and was initially known as Louis Antoine d'Artois. After his father's accession to the throne, he became fils de France, and his surname changed to de France, following the royal custom for princes with such rank.

Louis of France (1 November 1661 – 14 April 1711) was the eldest son and heir of Louis XIV, King of France, and his spouse, Maria Theresa of Spain. As the heir apparent to the French throne, he was styled Dauphin. He became known as Le Grand Dauphin after the birth of his own son, Le Petit Dauphin. As he died before his father, he never became king. His grandson became Louis XV of France.

Louis XVII (27 March 1785 – 8 June 1795), born Louis-Charles, was the younger son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. He was at birth given the title Duke of Normandy. His older brother, Louis Joseph, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. At his brother's death he became the heir apparent to the throne and the Dauphin of France, a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the style of Prince Royal of France. When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle-period of the French Revolution, he became King of France in the eyes of the royalists. However, since France was by then a republic, and Louis XVII had been imprisoned from August 1792 until his death from illness in 1795 at the age of 10, he never actually governed. His title stems from monarchist theory, whereby there is always a monarch; on the death of one monarch, the heir apparent or failing that the heir presumptive are immediately monarch. His title was the reason why on his death his uncle took the regnal name of Louis XVIII of France rather than Louis XVII, retaining it upon the Bourbon Restoration in 1814.

1003,"The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer is a 1970 British satirical film starring Peter Cook, and co-written by Cook, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, and Kevin Billington, who directed the film. The film was devised and produced by David Frost under the pseudonym David Paradine. Cleese and Chapman began writing the script following patronage from Frost. Cook and Billington were later called upon to complete the writing as, according to Cleese, he and Chapman had no idea what they were doing. The film satirised the growing influence of PR, spin and opinion polls in British politics, as well as parodying political figures of the time such as Harold Wilson and Enoch Powell. Cook admitted later that he had partly based his portrayal of the Rimmer character on David Frost, who provided funding for the film and took an executive producer credit.

The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a 1975 musical comedy horror film by 20th Century Fox, produced by Lou Adler and Michael White and directed by Jim Sharman. The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor Richard O'Brien, who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 musical stage production The Rocky Horror Show, with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a parody tribute to the science fiction and horror B movies of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, and Barry Bostwick and is narrated by Charles Gray with cast members from the original Royal Court Theatre, Roxy Theatre, and Belasco Theatre productions including Nell Campbell and Patricia Quinn. It is widely considered a Cult film. The story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is Dr. Frank N. Furter, an apparently mad scientist who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control. The film was shot in the United Kingdom at Bray Studios and on location at an old country estate named Oakley Court, best known for its earlier use by Hammer Film Productions. A number of props and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many kitsch science fiction and horror films, costume designer Sue Blane conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly affected the development of punk rock fashion trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair. Although largely critically panned on initial release, it soon became known as a midnight movie when audiences began participating with the film at the Waverly Theater in New York City in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This shadow cast mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-synching their character's lines. Still in limited release four decades after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. It is often shown close to Halloween. Today, the film has a large international cult following. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2005.

By the Bluest of Seas is a 1936 Soviet romantic comedy film by Russian director Boris Barnet. It is his second sound feature. Starring Yelena Kuzmina, Nikolai Kryuchkov, and Lev Sverdlin, the story centers on a love triangle between two castaways and a woman from a collective farm on a Soviet Azerbaijani island in the Caspian Sea. Modern critical reviews have hailed By the Bluest of Seas as a little known classic of Soviet cinema. Although some critics have noted that the story and characters are thinly written, high praise has been directed toward Barnet's direction and cinematography, his innovative use of sound, and the film's footage of the Caspian Sea. Some have perceived pro-communist propaganda within the film. However, many consider the film to be less politically overt than was common in Soviet cinema of the time. This, along with the film's divergence from the era's defining style of Socialist realism, has led many to view the film as unique. It has been reported that Barnet found himself in trouble with Joseph Stalin for these reasons. The film has long been elusive to Western audiences. It was never released on any home media format, until 2012, at which point it was made available by the Russian publisher Ruscico and the UK publisher Mr. Bongo Films.

A Countess from Hong Kong is a 1967 British romantic comedy film written, scored, and directed by Charlie Chaplin and starring Marlon Brando, Sophia Loren, Sydney Chaplin( Chaplin's third son), Tippi Hedren, Patrick Cargill and Margaret Rutherford. It was the last film directed, written, produced and scored by Chaplin, and one of two films Chaplin directed in which he did not play a major role( the other was 1923's A Woman of Paris), as well as his only color film. Chaplin's cameo marked his final screen appearance. The story is based loosely on the life of a woman Chaplin met in France, named Moussia Sodskaya, or Skaya, as he calls her in his 1922 book My Trip Abroad. She was a Russian singer and dancer who was a stateless person marooned in France without a passport. The idea, according to a press release written by Chaplin after the film received a negative reception, resulted from a visit I made to Shanghai in 1931 where I came across a number of titled aristocrats who had escaped the Russian Revolution. They were destitute and without a country, their status was of the lowest grade. The men ran rickshaws and the women worked in ten -cent dance halls. When the Second World War broke out many of the old aristocrats had died and the younger generation migrated to Hong Kong where their plight was even worse, for Hong Kong was overcrowded with refugees. It was originally started as a film called Stowaway in the 1930s, planned for Paulette Goddard, but production was never completed. This resulting film, created nearly 30 years after its inception, was a critical failure and grossed US$ 2 million from a US$3.5- million budget. However, it did prove to be extremely successful in Europe and Japan. In addition, the success of the music score was able to cover the budget.

He was also known as Walerian de Newburg. After the death of his brother, William de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Warwick, an impostor arose, claiming to be the deceased Earl; he gave Waleran a great deal of trouble in maintaining his claim. He does not appear to have been a great soldier, for he paid scutage money to escape military service in Wales. His position in the Court is attested by his bearing the right hand Sword of State at the Coronation of John, King of England, 27 May 1199. He liberally supported the hospital of St Michael's Hospital, Warwick and gave to the nuns of Pinley land at Claverdon, and land at Brailes to the nuns at Wroxall, Warwickshire.

1091,"Sobe, also known as Sovin, was the mother of St. Elizabeth and sister of St. Anne. The Bible records only that Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron and a cousin (or relative) of Mary. The name of Sobe first appears in writings of about the 8th century by Hippolytus of Thebes, Andrew of Crete, and Epiphanius Monachus, and later in Nicephorus Callistus and Andronicus. All recount essentially the same passage, given by the last two as follows: There were three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest, and Mary his wife, under the reign of Cleopatra and Sosipatrus, before the reign of Herod, the son of Antipater: the eldest was Mary, the second was Sobe, the youngest's name was Anne. The eldest being married in Bethlehem, had for daughter Salome the midwife; Sobe the second likewise married in Bethlehem, and was the mother of Elizabeth; last of all the third married in Galilee, and brought forth Mary the mother of Christ. The 19th-century mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich claims that according to her visions (which give a detailed genealogy of Mary), Sobe was a sister of Anne, but the mother of Elizabeth was Emerentia, Sobe and Anne's maternal aunt.

Mother Mary Cecilia Bailly, S.P., (June 2, 1815 – August 2, 1898) was the Superior General of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana from 1856–1868, directly succeeding the congregation's foundress Saint Mother Theodore Guerin. During her time in office, she began rebuilding the Academy (now Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College) and sent Sisters of Providence to staff military hospitals in Indianapolis and Vincennes, Indiana during the American Civil War. She was born Eleanor Cecilia Kinzie Bailly in Mackinac County, Michigan, on June 2, 1815. Her father was Joseph Aubert de Gaspé Bailly de Messein, a Canadian fur magnate of French descent, and her mother was Marie Le Fèvre de la Vigne (Tou-se-qua), a member of the Ottawa tribe. When Eleanor was seven, the family moved to the Joseph Bailly Homestead, Porter County, Indiana. This homestead was much traveled by various Native American tribes, including the Menominee, Winnebago, Fox and Dakota Sioux. A priest named John Guegeuen celebrated Mass at this homestead and directed Eleanor to the Sisters of Providence. Eleanor entered the community on November 25, 1841, at which time she became known as Sister Mary Cecilia. In 1843 she was selected to accompany Mother Theodore on a fundraising trip to France. The pair left Saint Mary-of-the-Woods on April 26, 1843, and sailed to France, where they spent time with the Sisters of Providence of Ruillé-sur-Loir. The sisters there, who expected a savage, were impressed by Bailly's education and fluent French. Guerin and Bailly also met with dignitaries including Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies, Queen of France. Upon returning, Bailly spent time teaching at the Academy, now Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, and took full administrative charge of the institute in 1848.

1099,"I Graduated, But... () is a 1929 Japanese silent film directed by Yasujir Ozu. The film is now lost, except for an excerpt of approximately 10 minutes. Ozu's friend and coworker Hiroshi Shimizu, who co-wrote the script, was originally slated to direct the film. Shimizu's wife Kinuyo Tanaka starred in the film. The plot involved a young man (Minoru Takada) who turns down a receptionist job after graduating college because he feels it isn't good enough for him, but needs to fool his mother (Utako Suzuki) and fiancee (Tanaka) into thinking he has a job. After he marries the fiancee he has to admit to her that he is unemployed so she takes a job in a bar. After an argument with her he apologizes for being irresponsible. He goes back to the company he turned down to accept the receptionist job, but they give him a salaried position instead. A poster from Harold Lloyd's silent comedy Speedy is used as a prop in the film. One visual gag in the film occurs when the man is apologizing to his wife and suddenly slaps her head, but it is then revealed that he was killing a mosquito. According to Donald Richie, Ozu's 1930 film  I Flunked, But... was based in part on this film. To David Bordwell I Was Flunked, But... presents the opposite situation to this film, in that the protagonist does not graduate and so does not have to face unemployment. Both films reflect a theme that runs through several of Ozu's films of the period, that of youth unemployment in Japan at the time. Akira Iwasaki described Ozu's films in the period starting with this film and extending to  I Was Born, But...  as having more directly depicted the psychological depression of the 'dark period' than any other films.  A Kinema Jumpo critic complained that the film's playfulness was jarring and that the happy ending detracted from the social message. Bordwell commented on the symmetry in the construction of the film, including how it begins and ends with scenes at the company office with opposite results, and how at first the man pretends to a job when he does not but later his fiancee pretends not to have one when she does.

1100,"Princess Hilda of Luxembourg( 15 February 1897, Berg Castle, Colmar- Berg, Luxembourg – 8 September 1979, Berg Castle, Colmar- Berg, Luxembourg) was a Princess of Luxembourg by birth and the Princess of Schwarzenberg by marriage.

Lewis of Luxembourg( or Louis II de Luxembourg; died 1443) was an Archbishop of Rouen, Bishop of Ely, and Cardinal. He was a younger son of John of Luxembourg, Lord of Beauvoir and Marguerite of Enghien. Lewis was elected archbishop of Rouen in 1436. He was the leading native administrator/ collaborator with the Lancastrian regime in France. His niece Jacquetta was the wife of John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, who acted as regent for his nephew Henry VI. As the Lancastrian position weakened, Lewis found his own fortunes and even personal safety becoming precarious. Although the city of Rouen did not fall to Charles VII of France until late 1449, well after Luxembourg's death, King Henry's government had long ago decided the archbishop needed and deserved remuneration and status based more securely in England. Thus he was provided to Ely' in commendam' on 27 September 1437. This was the fifth wealthiest see in England, yet also amongst the smallest in terms of size or burden. He is not known ever to have visited it. He died on 18 September 1443.

Marie of Luxembourg (1304 – 26 March 1324), was by birth member of the House of Luxembourg and by marriage Queen of France and Navarre. She was the daughter of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and Margaret of Brabant. Her two siblings were John of Luxembourg and Beatrice of Luxembourg, Queen of Hungary.

Who is the stepchild of Æthelred Of Mercia?",princess hilda of luxembourg,oshere,0.08261692523956299,0.0,False
1101,"Ælfwynn was the ruler of Mercia for a few months in 918, following her mother's death on 12 June 918. She was the daughter of Æthelred, ruler of English Mercia, and Æthelflæd( styled The Lady of Mercia). The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle states that she was deprived of all control in Mercia, and was led into Wessex three weeks before Christmas. Her accession was the only example of rule passing from one woman to another in the early medieval period in the British Isles.

Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians (870 – 12 June 918) ruled Mercia in the English Midlands from 911 until her death. She was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great, king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith. Æthelflæd was born around 870 at the height of the Viking invasions of England. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule – East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered, and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings – but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people not living in areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying Æthelflæd to Æthelred. Æthelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with Æthelflæd's brother, the future King Edward the Elder. Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified Worcester, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built a new minster in Gloucester. Æthelred's health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that Æthelflæd was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern Danelaw. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint, Oswald, which were translated to the new Gloucester minster. Æthelred died in 911 and Æthelflæd then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as one of the most unique events in early medieval history. Alfred had built a network of fortified burhs and in the 910s Edward and Æthelflæd embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were Wednesbury, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as her greatest triumph. In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. Æthelflæd was succeeded by her daughter Ælfwynn, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried Ælfwynn off to Wessex. Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under Æthelred and Æthelflæd but they agree that Æthelflæd was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury, who described her as a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul. According to Pauline Stafford, like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages. In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.

Anna Aloysia Maximiliane Louise von Lamberg(?- died 28 June 1738) was an Austrian countess who was successively the mistress of Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland, and Aleksander Benedykt Sobieski. She is known to history as Countess Esterle. Maximiliane was the daughter of an Austrian count, Kaspar Friedrich von Lamberg- Kunstadt, and his first wife, Marie Františka Terezie Hýzrlová z Chod, a Czech noblewoman. In 1695 she married Graf Franz Michael Hiserle( Esterle) von Chodau. She became the mistress of Augustus II the Strong in either 1696, with the affair lasting until 1699, or 1704( the latter date favoured by the author of Sex with Kings). Her first husband divorced her in 1697, and in 1698 she married graf Gustav Hanibal von Oppersdorff( Oppersdorf). On 1 November 1698, she gave birth to a son, graf von Oppersdorf, whose father was supposedly Augustus II. The child died soon after birth. Her relationship with Augustus II ended when the playboy king discovered that Maximiliane had been having affairs with several gentlemen at court; she was given 24 hours to leave the country. Later, in Wrocaw, she became the mistress of Aleksander Benedykt Sobieski, who had been Augustus's rival in the 1697 election for the Polish throne. She died on 28 June 1738 in Wrocaw. Her husband, Graf von Oppersdorff( Oppersdorf), died on 29 December 1744 in Kostelec nad Orlicí.

He gained national attention as the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Rackets Committee from 1957 to 1959, where he publicly challenged Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa over the corrupt practices of the union and authored The Enemy Within, a book about corruption in organized labor. Kennedy resigned from the committee to conduct his brother's campaign in the 1960 presidential election. He was appointed United States Attorney General after the successful election and served as the closest advisor to the President from 1961 to 1963. His tenure is best known for its advocacy for the civil rights movement, the fight against organized crime and the Mafia, and involvement in U.S. foreign policy related to Cuba. He authored his account of the Cuban Missile Crisis in a book titled Thirteen Days. After his brother's assassination, he remained in office in the Johnson Administration for several months. He left to run for the United States Senate from New York in 1964 and defeated Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating. In office, Kennedy opposed racial discrimination and U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He was an advocate for issues related to human rights and social justice and formed relationships with Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez. In 1968, Kennedy became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency by appealing to poor, African American, Hispanic, Catholic, and young voters. His main challenger in the race was Senator Eugene McCarthy. Shortly after winning the California primary around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was mortally wounded when shot with a pistol by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. Kennedy died the following morning. Sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though Kennedy's assassination, like his brother's, continues to be the subject of widespread analysis and numerous conspiracy theories.

1125,"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off is a song written by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin for the 1937 film Shall We Dance, where it was introduced by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers as part of a celebrated dance duet on roller skates. The music is marked Brightly. The song is most famous for its You like tomato / And I like to-mah-to  and other verses comparing their different regional dialects. The differences in pronunciation are not simply regional, however, but serve more specifically to identify class differences. At the time, typical American pronunciations were considered less refined by the upper-class, and there was a specific emphasis on the broadera sound. This class distinction with respect to pronunciation has been retained in caricatures, especially in the theater, where the longer a pronunciation is most strongly associated with the word darling. The song was ranked No. 34 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs.

He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera. Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song (1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically-charged, blood-soaked tale of a young village girl's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality (Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture (Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and independent festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles. During his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film  The Earth is a Sinful Song (1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier (1985) making it the 17th highest-grossing movie in the history of Finland.

The Humane Society formed in Simi Valley, California in 1965 as the Innocents. Their lineup consisted of Danny Wheetman on vocals and rhythm guitar, Jim Pettit on lead guitar, Woody Minnick on rhythm guitar, Richard Majewski on bass, Bill Schnetzler on drums. Producers Dick Torst and Dick Parker discovered the band while performing on a flatbed truck parked next to a local record store. They recorded their first single for Liberty Records in the spring of 1967, Tiptoe Through the Tulips With Me, now as the Humane Society, which pre-dated Tiny Tim's 1968 smash hit rendition of the novelty song. The flip side, Knock, Knock, however, is a study in contrasts and is a menacing and provocatively delivered slab of protopunk which has become the song for which the group is best known. The song features Danny Wheetman's furious ranting vocals, set to a backing which leads up to a violent high- speed rave- up. After Liberty rejected a proposed follow- up, the Humane Society signed with New World Records for their second single, Lorna which was released in 1968. However, the record received little airplay and went nowhere. The band dissolved shortly thereafter.  Knock Knock appeared on the box set, released in 1998. In Mike Markesich's, Teenbeat Mayhem, based on a balloting of noted garage rock writers and experts, the song Knock Knock receives a ranking of ten and is listed at# 214 on that book's list of 1000 greatest garage rock records of all time.

Though much of Hunt's personal life is obscure, it is known he served in the First World War, and his first professional work as a musician was as a member in a traveling minstrel show, in the early 1920s. On March 28, 1928, Hunt and his group, the Texas Ramblers, which included violinist Harmon Clem and an unknown guitarist, recorded in San Antonio for Okeh Records. Of the sides the group laid down, Blues in the Bottle was arguably his most accomplished for its diverse assortment of country blues, ragtime and old- time music. It was later included in Rich Nevins' compilation album, Times Ai n’t Like They Used to Be, Volume 1 along with other contemporaries. In addition to being a recording artist, Hunt regularly performed on local radio stations and venues, usually in blackface, with his neighbors Doc and Oscar Harper. Hunt particularly favored the neighborhood known as Deep Ellum, which was also frequented by other blues musicians, but notorious for its red-light district. On June 26, 1929, Hunt and the Texas Ramblers recorded for the last time, with the session taking place in Dallas. Among the six songs recorded was Wake Up, Jacob which was featured on the renowned compilation created by Harry Everett Smith, Anthology of American Folk Music, in 1952. An unknown composition was cut, but was either never released or no original copies exist. The song, Oklahoma Rag was released as under Prince Albert Hunt and Hermon Clem. The recordings were later seen as a primary influence in Western swing and country music in general. On 31 March 1931 Hunt was shot to death outside Confederate Hall. His assailant, William M. Douglas, reported that he murdered Hunt out of jealousy for dancing with his wife. In 1974, a documentary titled Memories of Prince Albert Hunt was released and was centered on the musician's life.

His birthday (14 December 1895) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Prince Albert, the Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been rather distressed. Two days later, he wrote again: I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her. Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good. Consequently, he was baptised Albert Frederick Arthur George at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as Bertie. His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name may supplant the less favoured one.
