There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean - ass fighting machine.'' Gunn also based the character on himself. Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, ``I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas guy. ''Cooper voiced Rocket, while Sean Gunn (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming. James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators, though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film. Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance`` the fast - talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket.''

Antiochus( 221 BC ‚Äì 193 BC) was a Seleucid prince, first- born child to the Seleucid monarchs Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III, and his father's first heir.

Laodice of the Sameans
Laodice was a Queen of an unknown Kingdom in Asia. She lived at the time of the Seleucid king of Syria Antiochus X Eusebes who reigned 95 BC- 92 or 88 BC.

Laodice (wife of Mithridates III of Pontus)
Laodice (fl. late 3rd ‚Äì early 2nd centuries BCE) was a Greek Princess from the Seleucid Empire and the wife of King Mithridates III of Pontus. Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice and Laodice VI. Laodice bore Mithridates III three children: Mithridates IV of Pontus, Pharnaces I of Pontus and Laodice.

Antiochus IX Cyzicenus
Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus (""Antiochus the Pious, the Cyzicene"") was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom. He was the son of Antiochus VII Sidetes and Cleopatra Thea.

In 112 BC, Antiochus IX's wife, Cleopatra IV, was killed by her sister Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus VIII. Tryphaena herself died shortly afterwards. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; he was succeeded by his sons Seleucus VI and Demetrius III. Antiochus IX then took the capital Antioch and married his deceased wife's sister Cleopatra Selene, who was herself the widow of Antiochus VIII. Seleucus VI continued the war against his uncle. Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus was killed in battle in 96 BC.

Antiochus VII Sidetes
Antiochus VII Euergetes (c.164/160 BC - 129 BC) , nicknamed Sidetes  (from Side, a city in Asia Minor), also known as Antiochus the Pious, was ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from July/August 138 to 129 BC. He was the last Seleucid king of any stature. After Antiochus was killed in battle, the Seleucid realm was restricted to Syria.

In this song, Gwenc'hlan is imprisoned after having his eyes gouged out for refusing to convert to Christianity, sings out that he is n't afraid to die and makes a prophecy wherein he will be avenged. The motive of the blinded prisoner is reminiscent of the historical fate of Boethius.

The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1934 British thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, featuring Peter Lorre, and released by Gaumont British.

The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book- length interview"" Hitchcock/ Truffaut""( 1967), in response to filmmaker Fran√ßois Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied,"" Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional."" However, it's been claimed this statement can not be taken at face value. The 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with G. K. Chesterton's 1922 book of detective stories of the same name. Hitchcock decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the stories in the book.

Conversely, some Slavs were assimilated into other populations.

Slavs
Alternative proposals for the etymology of *Slovƒõnin—ä propounded by some scholars have much less support. Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of worshipper, in this context meaning ""practicer of a common Slavic religion,"" and from that evolved into an ethnonym. S.B. Bernstein speculates that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European *(s)lawos, cognate to Ancient Greek ŒªŒ±œåœÇ la√≥s ""population, people,"" which itself has no commonly accepted etymology. Meanwhile, others have pointed out that the suffix -enin indicates a man from a certain place, which in this case should be a place called Slova or Slava, possibly a river name. The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek (1907‚Äì1986) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slovene.

Hair transplantation
Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding, (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face - lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.

The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1934 British thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, featuring Peter Lorre, and released by Gaumont British. It was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of Hitchcock's British period. The film is Hitchcock's first film using this title and was followed later with his own 1956 film using the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book-length interview ""Hitchcock/Truffaut"" (1967), in response to filmmaker Fran√ßois Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, ""Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional."" However, it's been claimed this statement cannot be taken at face value. The 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with G. K. Chesterton's 1922 book of detective stories of the same name.

The sedan, in Standard, Business and Special trim levels, and a coupe utility were announced in October 1953 and were followed by a Panel van derivative in December of that year. A wagon prototype was built but the bodystyle was not put into production. In 1954, Holden's first exports began with sales of the FJ in New Zealand. The FJ, of monocoque construction, broadly followed the silhouette of its predecessor, but featured a bolder horizontal styled front grille, along with comfort and decoration upgrades in a new sedan model named the' Holden Special'. Originally specified as achieved at 3,800 rpm, the claimed maximum power output from the six- cylinder engine was increased to achieved at 4,000 rpm. In 1955 the car underwent a mild interior facelift for the Holden Special sedan, along with a variation in paint and trim options. The FJ series was progressively replaced by models from the Holden FE series from July 1956 to May 1957 with a total of 169,969 examples produced. There are nearly 20 specific FX- FJ Holden Car Clubs of Australia with members committed to preserving them.

318,"Mercia
When √Üthelfl√¶d died in 918, √Ülfwynn, her daughter by √Üthelred, succeeded as 'Second Lady of the Mercians', but within six months Edward had deprived her of all authority in Mercia and taken her into Wessex.

Osthryth
Osthryth (died 697), queen of the Mercians, was the wife of King √Üthelred and daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his second wife Eanfl√¶d. She probably married √Üthelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhfl√¶d had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhfl√¶d's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means ""stronghold of Fl√¶de"", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s √Üthelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by √Üthelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that √Üthelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. √Üthelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. √Üthelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against √Üthelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother √Ülfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was ""a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King √Üthelred had married his sister."" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of √Üthelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.

√Üthelred of Mercia
√Üthelred (died after 704) was King of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, √Üthelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain. He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. √Üthelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; √Üthelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria. √Üthelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 √Üthelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. √Üthelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was √Üthelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that √Üthelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.

Eadwig √Ütheling
Eadwig, who was now the last surviving son by his father's first marriage, was banished in 1016 and then outlawed in 1017 by Cnut, however he was reconciled with Cnut the same year and allowed to live in England, but was murdered soon after at the instigation of Cnut, possibly after attempting to rally resistance in the south west. The Anglo-Saxon claim to the throne then passed to the elder son of √Üthelred's second marriage, the future Edward the Confessor. Eadwig was buried at Tavistock Abbey a place built by his uncle Ordwulf.

Westminster Abbey
Henry III rebuilt the abbey in honour of a royal saint, Edward the Confessor, whose relics were placed in a shrine in the sanctuary. Henry III himself was interred nearby, as were many of the Plantagenet kings of England, their wives and other relatives. Until the death of George II of Great Britain in 1760, most kings and queens were buried in the abbey, some notable exceptions being Henry VI, Edward IV, Henry VIII and Charles I who are buried in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Other exceptions include Richard III, now buried at Leicester Cathedral, and the de facto queen Lady Jane Grey, buried in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London. Most monarchs and royals who died after 1760 are buried either in St George's Chapel or at Frogmore to the east of Windsor Castle.[citation needed]

352,"Meritaten Tasherit
Meritaten Tasherit, which means"" Meritaten the Younger"" was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Elizabeth herself was a product of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham, and wrote occasional poems such as On Monsieur's Departure at critical moments of her life. Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon. All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated, as was much of the nobility, and Italian literature had a considerable following, providing the sources for many of Shakespeare's plays. English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method, a forerunner of the Scientific Method. The language of the Book of Common Prayer, first published in 1549, and at the end of the period the Authorised Version (``King James Version ''to Americans) of the Bible (1611) had enduring impacts on the English consciousness.

477,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow: An eccentric pirate characterized by his slightly drunken swagger, slurred speech and awkwardly flailing hand gestures. He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name ""Jack Sparrow""; however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, ""a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate."" At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards. Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, ""He's ruining the film!"" Depp answered back, ""Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot.""

The film examines Jack's backstory, with the young Jack portrayed by Anthony De La Torre, whose face was replaced by a CGI replica of Depp as he looked in 21 Jump Street and What's Eating Gilbert Grape. R√∏nning felt de-aging Depp was tricky against the canon of the franchise.

During her son's reign, she developed a rivalry with her daughter-in-law, Empress He, because she wanted Emperor Ling's younger son, Liu Xie, to be crown prince while Empress He wanted her own son, Liu Bian to succeed his father. Emperor Ling died in 189 before he managed to designate either of his two sons as crown prince. Liu Bian eventually took the throne as Emperor Shao; Empress Dowager Dong, as the emperor's grandmother, became grand empress dowager, while her daughter-in-law became empress dowager. Empress Dowager He eventually conspired with her brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, to unseat her mother-in-law from power.

Lion
Lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, either as a device on shields or as supporters, but the lioness is used much less frequently. The formal language of heraldry, called blazon, employs French terms to describe the images precisely. Such descriptions specify whether lions or other creatures are ""rampant"" (rearing) or ""passant"" (crouching).Lions continue to appear in modern literature as characters including the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, and the comedic Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Lion symbolism was used from the advent of cinema; one of the most iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of the Kenyan lioness Elsa in the movie Born Free, which is based on the factual book of the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King, the 2005 DreamWorks animated character Alex in Madagascar, and the 2006 Disney animated character Samson in The Wild.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 30 BC ‚Äì 33 AD) was a Roman senator, politician and general, praised by the historian Tacitus.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger or Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor( died 30 BC), was the only child of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and his wife Junia Secunda, a half- sister to Brutus the Younger, one of Julius Caesar's assassins.

Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus
Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (flourished 1st century BC) was the brother of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and son to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the consul of 78 BC. His mother may have been a daughter of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (78 BC)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( 120 BC ‚Äì 77 BC) was a Roman statesman and general. After the death of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, he attempted to undermine the Sullan constitution and revive the"" populares"" faction. This brought him into conflict with the optimates whom Sulla had put back in power. In 77 BC, when he was recalled from his proconsulship of Gaul, he returned to Rome at the head of an army and an armed conflict erupted. Lepidus' forces were defeated in a battle near the Milvian Bridge and as a result his rebellion failed. He was the father of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and of one of the consuls for 50 BC Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus.

Aemilia Lepida was the sister of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( 6 -39) who was married to Caligula's favorite sister Drusilla and who was executed in Caligula's reign. In her younger years, Lepida was betrothed to Claudius, but her parents fell out of favour with Augustus so the emperor broke off the engagement. In AD 8, her mother Julia the Younger( otherwise called Vipsania Julia) was exiled for adultery, like her own mother Julia. Her father Lucius was executed in 14 for participating in a conspiracy against Augustus. By AD 13, Lepida had married Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a member of the patrician branch of the ancient gens Junia. Their children were: The time of her death is not known.

Charles XI of Sweden
Charles XI, also Carl  (24 November 1655 ‚Äì 5 April 1697 OS) was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611‚Äì1718). He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604‚Äì1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.

Oscar II of Sweden
Oscar II (Oscar Fredrik; 21 January 1829 ‚Äì 8 December 1907) was the King of Sweden from 1872 until his death, and was also the final King of Norway from the House of Bernadotte. Oscar II was King during a time when both Sweden and Norway were undergoing a period of industrialization and rapid technological progress. His reign also saw the gradual decline of the Union of Sweden and Norway, which culminated in its dissolution in 1905. He was subsequently succeeded as King of Norway by his grandnephew Prince Carl of Denmark under the regnal name Haakon VII, and as King of Sweden by his eldest son, Gustaf V.
Oscar II is the paternal great-great-grandfather of Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden since 1973. Harald V, King of Norway since 1991, is a great-grandson of Oscar II, through his third son Prince Carl, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland.

Prince Carl of Sweden and Norway, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland (27 February 1861 ‚Äì 24 October 1951) was a Swedish prince.

Eochaid mac √Åeda Find is a spurious King of D√°l Riata found in some rare High Medieval king-lists and in older history books. Supposedly a son of √Åed Find (died 778) and successor to √Åed's brother Fergus mac Echdach, Eochaid is now thought to represent a misplacing of the reign of Eochaid mac Echdach. The reigns of Selbach mac Ferchair, D√∫ngal mac Selbaig and, perhaps, Alp√≠n mac Echdach, are similarly misplaced in the sources which contain this Eochaid.

Both Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef were sons of a king called Sobekemsaf, most probably Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf (Sobekemsaf II today, not I) based on an inscription from a doorjamb from a 17th Dynasty temple at Gebel Antef. While his own tomb has not been located, it was likely located in the area of Dra' Abu el-Naga' where the pyramid tomb of his brother Nubkheperre Intef was found in 2001. The pyramidion of the pyramid of Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef's pyramid was found in Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It has a slope of 60 degrees and is inscribed with this king's names. The pyramidion is now in the British Museum (BM EA 478).

Kekheretnebti
Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30‚Äì35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.

Isetnofret (daughter of Khaemwaset)
Isetnofret was an Ancient Egyptian woman and daughter of the high priest of Ptah and king's son Khaemweset( lived around 1200 BC). She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called"" daughter of his body"". On a relief found at Saqqara she is called"" his beloved daughter"" and"" king's daughter"". Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the"" noble woman"" Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.

Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit
Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit are two small princesses who appear in scenes dating to the later part of the reign of Akhenaten. The titles of at least one of the princess is of the form ""[...-ta]sherit, born of [...], born of the King's Great Wife [...]. The inscription is damaged and the name of the mother and grandmother of the princesses has not been preserved. Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit has been known to archaeologists since 1938, when a talatat block with her picture and name was found in Hermopolis.

Spanish was brought to Mexico in the 16th century. As in all other Spanish - speaking countries (including Spain), different accents and varieties of the language exist in different parts of the country, for both historical and sociological reasons. Among these, the varieties that are best known outside of the country are those of central Mexico -- both educated and uneducated varieties -- largely because the capital, Mexico City, hosts most of the mass communication media with international projection. For this reason, most of the film dubbing identified abroad with the label ``Mexican Spanish ''or`` Latin American Spanish'' actually corresponds to the central Mexican variety.

Elisabeth's birthdate is unknown. Medieval sources do not even indicate whether the Hungarian princess was her mother. Elizabeth is believed to have been her daughter only because both had the same name. Some scholars report that Elizabeth was born about 1152 or 1154.

Elisabeth of Bohemia (1358‚Äì1373)
Elisabeth of Bohemia( 1358‚Äì1373) was the daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Anne of Schweidnitz. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Elisabeth of Bohemia( 1292‚Äì1330). She had a brother, Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, and one half sister, Katharine of Bohemia, whose mother was Blanche of Valois who was Charles IV's previous wife. Elisabeth had another half sister who was the daughter of Blanche, Margaret of Bohemia but she died in 1349, so Elisabeth never knew her. After the death of her mother, Charles remarried for the last time to Elizabeth of Pomerania. Elisabeth gained six half- siblings from the marriage: Anna, Queen of England, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, Margaret"" the younger"" of Bohemia, John of G√∂rlitz, Charles, and Henry. Elisabeth married when she was only eight in 1366 to Albert III, Duke of Austria. Elisabeth and Albert had no children and she died aged only fifteen in 1373; she was buried with Albert's parents in Gaming Charterhouse in Lower Austria. Her husband remarried to Beatrix of Nuremberg and they were parents of Albert IV, Duke of Austria.

Elizabeth of Slavonia( 1352 ‚Äì before 1380), member of the Hungarian branch of the Capetian House of Anjou, was the heir presumptive to the Hungarian throne between 1360 and 1370. Elizabeth was the only daughter of Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, a younger son of the Hungarian king Charles I. Her mother was Margaret of Bavaria, and her only known sibling John, Duke of Slavonia( 1354 ‚Äì 1360). Elizabeth was regarded as heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary after the death of her brother, as her uncle Louis I had no children. Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, wanted her to marry his eldest son, Wenceslaus. However, the marriage negotiations were ended in 1370, when a daughter named Catherine was born to Elizabeth's uncle. Catherine was followed by two sisters, which meant that Elizabeth would not inherit the Holy Crown of Hungary. In October 1370, Elizabeth married Philip II, Prince of Taranto, a 41- year- old widower and pretender to the Latin Empire. Philip had survived his children by his previous marriage and was in need of heirs. As her dower, Elizabeth was granted Corfu as a personal fief. Their only known child, a son named Philip, was born in 1371 and died the same year. Elizabeth was widowed on 25 November 1374. She appears to have died before the end of the 1380s.

Goli Soda
Baradwaj Rangan wrote ""The signature achievement of ""Goli Soda"" is its ruthless unmasking of how hollow most of our masala movies are, and how, with a little imagination, just a little, you can make a film which does not insult the audience"" and went on to state, ""I will be very surprised if there's a more entertaining, more inventive, more well-acted masala movie this year"". The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity"". Cinemalead.com rated it with 4/5 stars and said ""Overall if you prefer to watch a gutsy film which is different and unique from the routine Tamil cinema, go and watch Goli Soda which surely deserves a repeated viewing"".

The Billings Library was then converted to a student center in 1963. After the building was determined to have been outgrown for student center purposes, the Dudley H. Davis Center was built and completed in 2007 to be the university's new student center.

The film was directed by Charles Walters. This whimsical (even by Astaire's standards) musical failed at the box office and impressed few critics at the time, mainly due to the nature of the plot which empowers lovers to float free of the influence of gravity - a conceit reprised in the 1999 film ""Simply Irresistible"". Astaire was reluctant to take the project - he was originally supposed to play the role in 1946 but had avoided it through retirement. Clearly stung by its failure, Astaire later claimed that the dance routines - of which there are more than usual - are of a particularly high standard - a rare verdict from such a notoriously self-critical artist. Vera-Ellen is generally viewed as one of Astaire's most technically proficient dance partners, and this was a factor in his readiness to expand the dance content of the film beyond its traditional proportions.

In the published version of ""The Silmarillion"", Orodreth () was an Elf of the First Age, the second son of Finarfin (with Finrod Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel being his siblings), and a ruler of Nargothrond.

Finarfin
Finarfin was the third son and youngest child of Finw√´. Finarfin's mother was Finw√´'s second wife Indis. F√´anor was his half-brother and Fingolfin his full brother. His sisters were Findis and Irim√´. He married E√§rwen, princess of the Teleri. He had four children: Finrod Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor and Galadriel. Orodreth appears as one of Finarfin's sons in the published ""Silmarillion""; in Tolkien's later writings however he clearly is Angrod's son. Christopher Tolkien used an older version of the genealogy in the ""Silmarillion"", but later described this as a mistake. Finarfin was said to be the fairest and wisest of Finw√´'s sons.

There are two articles for Canadian band The Poppy Family:

Renegades (band)
Renegades were a British rock band which started out as a side-project from two members of the band Feeder, featuring guitarist Grant Nicholas and bassist Taka Hirose, before becoming a pseudonym name for Feeder themselves. Nicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother, who completed the group and a four-track EP was then recorded. Soon later, Renegades became an alternative name for Feeder at various concerts where they would play an entire show pretending not to be Feeder, but a different band with the same members. If Feeder songs released before the ""Renegades"" album were to be played, the band would announce that they're covering Feeder songs. Grant Nicholas once introduced ""Tangerine"" as ""A cover of a song from a band we know"". The idea was created when Feeder parted company with drummer Mark Richardson who returned to his previous band Skunk Anansie. Brazil was initially contracted with the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university events, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was however recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before the idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the 'Renegades' project. The tracks originally intended for the side-project were soon used for the seventh Feeder album ""Renegades"". The side-project was as a result used as a method to promote the ""Renegades"" album at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder. On the first of January 2010, a four-day countdown timer was added to the band's official website. As the countdown was completed on 6 January 2010, the title-track for the EP, ""Renegades"" was released as a free download as well as a package containing the limited edition EP, Renegades shirt, badge set and an e-ticket for one of the six shows available. The ""Renegades EP"" was the first release on the band's own record label, before being followed-up by a second EP. Feeder also used the Renegades name for their Sonisphere 2010 appearance, which was their last UK show using this name and also their tour of Japan in July of the same year. The track ""Renegades"" was re-released, but this time as a Feeder single instead of Renegades and was also on vinyl and download only.

All Time Low
In mid-February 2017, the band announced a new song to be premiered on BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Nick Grimshaw, called ``Dirty Laundry ''. The music video was directed by Pat Tracy, who had also directed the music video for`` Missing You''. This was the first release after changing record labels from Hopeless Records to Fueled by Ramen. Both songs are singles from their album, Last Young Renegade, which was released on June 2, 2017. The band also released their cover of ``Longview ''by Green Day for the documentary`` Green Day: The Early Years''.

Renegade Five is a rock band from Karlstad, Sweden. It consists of Anders Fernette( vocals), H√•kan Fredriksson( keyboard), Per Lid√©n( guitar), Jimmy Lundin( bass) and Marcus Nowak( drums).

Another popular speculation posits Konstantin Dobrynich as the father of Ostromir. According to the First Sophia Chronicle, Ostromir died in 1056 during his military campaign against the Chudes.

In spite of the Portuguese revolution against the Spanish Habsburgs, his nephew, Raimundo of Lencastre, 4th Duke of Aveiro actively supported the rights of the Habsburg Kings and, in 1663, the new King of the Braganza Dynasty, John IV, decided to confiscate the Dukedom. However, Peter of Lencastre, a Braganza supporter, requested the cancellation of this decision and, finally in 1668, he was recognised as 5th Duke of Aveiro and Marquis of Torres Novas. Later the same year, when the peace between Portugal and Spain was signed, Peter's niece, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, sister and heir of the 4th Duke, requested the cancellation of the decision that granted the Dukedom of Aveiro to her uncle, in order to obtain it for herself. Due to Peter of Lencastre's death in 1673, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, still living in Spain, was recognised as the new Duchess of Aveiro on condition she would return to Portugal.

Gabriel of Lencastre, 7th Duke of Aveiro
His full name was Gabriel de Lencastre Ponce de Le√≥n Manrique de Lara C√°denas Gir√≥n y Aragon( 1667 ‚Äì 1745), known as"" Dom"" Gabriel of Lencastre. He was the 2nd son of Manuel Ponce de Le√≥n, 6th Duke of Los Arcos, in Spain, and Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, 6th Duchess of Aveiro. His mother was recognised by the Portuguese King, as Duchess of Aveiro, in 1679, on the condition she would return to Portugal. Due to her husband's opposition, she divorced him, returned to her homeland and regained the House of Aveiro and their estates. Their elder son, Don Joaqu√≠n, would inherited the Spanish House of the Dukes of Los Arcos, while the younger, Dom Gabriel, would inherited the Portuguese House of the Dukes of Aveiro. Only after his mother's death( 1715), he came to Portugal. While he lived in Spain, King Charles II granted him the title of Duke of Ba√±os, and he served in the Spanish army, both in the Catalonia and in the Flanders campaigns. He died single without issue. After his death the Duchy was claimed by his nephew, Ant√≥nio de Lencastre Ponce de Le√≥n( son of Joaquin 7th Duke of Los Arcos), and by Jos√© de Mascarenhas, 8th Count of Santa Cruz and 5th Marquis of Gouveia( descending from √Ålvaro and Juliana of Lencastre through female line).

Afonso of Lencastre
Afonso of Lencastre( 1597 ‚Äì 1654), was a Portuguese nobleman, son of the 3rd Dukes of Aveiro, √Ålvaro and Juliana of Lencastre. This family descended from the Infante George of Lencastre, therefore they had royal blood. By a royal decree dated from 8 April 1627, King Philip III of Portugal( aka Philip IV of Spain) granted him the new title of Marquis of Porto Seguro. In spite of the Portuguese revolution of 1 December 1640, Afonso remained faithful to the Spanish Habsburgs. To reward his fidelity, King Philip IV granted him, by a decree issued on 23 March 1642, the new titles of Duke of Abrantes and Marquis of Sardoal. However, as Philip IV was no longer King of Portugal, these two titles were never recognise by the Portuguese authorities. D. Afonso was born in his family palace, in Azeit√£o( near Set√∫bal), Portugal, and, on 15 July 1627, he married a Spanish lady, Ana de Sande de Padilla, 2nd Marchioness of Valdefuentes.

The Pursuit of Happiness (1988 film)
The Pursuit of Happiness is a 1988 Australian film directed by Martha Ansara. In the mid 1980s Ansara was involved in the Australian anti-nuclear movement and wanted to make a film about Australia's relationship with the US. She originally intended to make a documentary but then it evolved into a dramatic feature about a married relationship that acted as a paradigm for the US- Australia relationship. Ansara: It was a bit of a crude analysis, but it took so long to make( under the 10 BA system) that by the time we finished the film- it was 1987- for various reasons, the anti-nuclear movement was on the way out, so the film missed its time. And with films, timing is everything. If we had done it in a year, which we could n't, it probably would have done very, very well. As it was, it did return 40 percent to the investors, but that was because it was very low- budget. The interesting thing about the film is that, if the audience was not very sophisticated, they liked it enormously. If they were sophisticated, they thought it was really daggy.

But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film.

The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1934 British thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, featuring Peter Lorre, and released by Gaumont British. It was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of Hitchcock's British period. The film is Hitchcock's first film using this title and was followed later with his own 1956 film using the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book-length interview ""Hitchcock/Truffaut"" (1967), in response to filmmaker Fran√ßois Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, ""Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional."" However, it's been claimed this statement cannot be taken at face value. The 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with G. K. Chesterton's 1922 book of detective stories of the same name. Hitchcock decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the stories in the book.

According to the writer of Luke, Mary was a relative of Elizabeth, wife of the priest Zechariah of the priestly division of Abijah, who was herself part of the lineage of Aaron and so of the tribe of Levi.[Luke 1:5;1:36] Some of those who consider that the relationship with Elizabeth was on the maternal side, consider that Mary, like Joseph, to whom she was betrothed, was of the House of David and so of the Tribe of Judah, and that the genealogy of Jesus presented in Luke 3 from Nathan, third son of David and Bathsheba, is in fact the genealogy of Mary,[need quotation to verify] while the genealogy from Solomon given in Matthew 1 is that of Joseph. (Aaron's wife Elisheba was of the tribe of Judah, so all their descendants are from both Levi and Judah.)[Num.1:7 & Ex.6:23]

Sink or Swim is an experimental film written and directed by Su Friedrich originally released in 1990. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it"" culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Through a series of twenty six short stories,"" Sink or Swim"" describes the childhood events that shaped a girl's ideas about fatherhood, family relations, work and play. As the stories unfold, a dual portrait emerges: that of a father who cared more for his career than for his family, and of a daughter who was deeply affected by his behavior. Working in counterpoint to the forceful text are sensual black and white images that depict both the extraordinary and ordinary events of daily life. Together, they create a formally complex and emotionally intense film. The film's title comes from an incident from Friedrich's childhood when her father taught her to swim by throwing her in the water after explaining the science behind swimming.
