Edith was murdered in a madhouse by Nazi doctors during the war. My rebellious mother is definitely a part of me, I was lucky enough to put my craziness into my films, the director commented in a later interview.  Two Mothers was a hit in German television. It was very well received, even but usual critics of Praunheim's work.  They seemed to love this one, the director explained, because they can identify with its narrative.

Who is the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes?",emilio vieyra,ptolemy ix lathyros,0.24161167442798615,0.0,False
9,"Antiochus( 221 BC – 193 BC) was a Seleucid prince, first- born child to the Seleucid monarchs Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III, and his father's first heir.

Antiochus X Eusebes Philopator (–92 or 88 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as the King of Syria between 95 BC and 92 BC or 89/88 BC (224 SE (Seleucid year)). He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII. The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians. Numismatic evidence shows that AntiochusX was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital in SE (88/87 BC).

Antiochus II Epiphanes, also known as Antiochus II of Commagene (flourished 1st century BC) was a man of Armenian and Greek descent. Antiochus II was a prince from the Kingdom of Commagene and the second son of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene and Queen Isias Philostorgos. He was the youngest brother of prince and future king Mithridates II of Commagene. Very little is known of Antiochus II. In 29 BC, he was summoned to Rome by the Emperor Augustus for causing the assassination of an ambassador Mithridates II had sent to Rome. Antiochus II was subsequently executed on Augustus’ orders.

20,"Do n't Look Now( lit.  In Venice ... a shocking red December) is a 1973 independent film directed by Nicolas Roeg. It is a thriller adapted from the short story by Daphne du Maurier. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland portray a married couple who travel to Venice following the recent accidental death of their daughter, after the husband accepts a commission to restore a church. They encounter two sisters, one of whom claims to be clairvoyant and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of danger. The husband at first dismisses their claims, but starts to experience mysterious sightings himself. While Do n't Look Now observes many conventions of the thriller genre, it focuses on the psychology of grief and the effect the death of a child can have on a relationship. Its depiction of grief has been identified as unusually strong for a film featuring supernatural plot elements.  Do n't Look Now is renowned for its innovative editing style, recurring motifs and themes, and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit by the standards of then- contemporary mainstream cinema. It also employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with the depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques. Its reputation has grown in the years since its release and it is now considered a classic and an influential work in horror and British film.

Comte Médéric de Vasselot de Régné ( 4 August 1837 – 23 April 1919) was a French- born forest officer trained at the National School of Forestry in Nancy, France, and appointed as Superintendent of Woods and Forests in South Africa in 1880. Médéric and his elder brother Marin Gabriel were sons of Jean Gabriel Charles Auguste de Vasselot de Régné( 1780 – 1842) and Eugénie Gabrielle Elisabeth Selima Vasselot de la Chesnaye( 1807 – 1879). Since the earliest days of European settlement at the Cape, the indigenous forests of the southern Cape were used as a seemingly inexhaustible source of timber and fuel. From 1652 when Jan van Riebeeck landed at the Cape until the 1880s, the forests and the fauna they supported were despoiled in the same way as those of the United States and Australia, with little or no thought given to sustainability. About 1776 a woodcutting centre was established at George, a step which heralded a century of plundering of the surrounding forests. An improved road between Swellendam and George saw an ever- increasing number of settlers and adventurers eager to participate in the timber boom. The perception was that of an unlimited resource, leading to excessively wasteful practices where only the choicest grades and sizes of timber were removed, and the majority of cut trees were simply left to rot. In 1778, the Governor Joachim van Plettenberg inspected the region and was appalled at the destruction. As a result, Johann Fredrick Meeding was appointed Resident at Plettenberg Bay in an effort to instil some form of control over the cutting. Meeding diligently performed his duties and his post survived a number of successive changes of government which followed British occupation of the Cape in 1795. Even so, no new conservation measures were introduced, and when Graaff- Reinet was founded in 1786 the timber boom resumed with wholesale cutting of the forests between George and Knysna, the official founding of George in 1811 aggravating the destruction. A further burden on the forests was the Royal Navy's extraction of timber to meet the needs of the dockyard at Simonstown, a situation which lasted until 1825 when iron saw an increasing use in boat- building. The withdrawal of the Navy's workers led to an immediate occupation of the vacated areas by new woodcutters. The start of the Great Trek in 1836 caused new waves of cutters from the Langkloof to invade the forests of the Tsitsikamma in the Humansdorp area. To make matters worse the Government decided in 1846 to sell the worked- out forests as agricultural lots. Of the remaining forest only a narrow strip stretching between the Keurbooms and Kaaimans Rivers were under State control and the local magistrate issued felling permits to woodcutters in an attempt to gather as much revenue as possible. By 1847 the situation had become so critical that all Crown Forests were declared closed. A Conservator of Forests was appointed assisted by 4 rangers. This protection was short- lived and in 1856 the forests were re-opened. The second Conservator of Forests was appointed at this time and was a retired Army officer, Captain Christopher Harison, a man with no forestry training, but with remarkable aptitude for his new career. He made himself familiar with European silviculture and adopted the practice of exploiting the forests in sections which led to better control and greatly reduced waste. He was also an outspoken critic of Crown Forest alienation and it was largely due to his efforts that this practice was stopped. The Colonial Botanist, Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe, issued dire warnings about the extent of destruction and became another voice supporting the growing conservation mood. The appointment of Captain Baron de Fin as Conservator of Forests at Keiskammahoek followed in 1865. Despite the warnings, matters carried on in much the same way until the great forest fire of February 1869 in which large parts of the forest between George and the Bloukrans River were completely destroyed. The matter was raised in Parliament and a commission consisting of Captain Harison and Thomas Bain was appointed. Following this Captain Harison was appointed as Conservator of Forests for the Knysna region in 1874. His work was bedevilled by the timber needs of the railway line to Kimberley and the short- lived gold rush at Millwood in 1876. De Vasselot's appointment as Superintendent of Woods and Forests followed in 1880. This was the first time that a professional forester had been put in charge and was a turning point in South African forestry. For the first time the authorities were persuaded that a sound silvicultural policy was of greater importance than the revenue derived from exploitation. The details of the new management system were spelled out in the Forest Regulation of 1883. When de Vasselot left the Cape in 1891, the forests of George, Knysna and the Tsitsikamma were being managed on a scientific basis. Two important publications by de Vasselot in 1885 were an Introduction to the Systematic Treatment of the Crown Forests of the Cape Colony and a pamphlet on Selection and Seasoning of Wood, both translated into English by the then Conservator of Transkeian Forests, A. W. Heywood. In 1898 Heywood was succeeded by Colin MacNaughton as Conservator at Knysna, where he marked out the first permanent sample plots in the forests to study indigenous tree communities, laying a valuable foundation for research into forest ecosystems. McNaughton strongly believed that the ‘ forests must be worked in the interests of the country, and not in the interests of the immediate population ’. That is, trees should be considered a national resource, and not relevant to the livelihood of communities who exploited the forest. De Vasselot is commemorated in the de Vasselot Nature Reserve surrounding Nature's Valley.

She was the daughter of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland, and his wife, the former Frances Montagu, herself a daughter of Sir Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton.

John Adams (October 30, 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding Father who served as the second president of the United States, from 1797 to 1801. Before his presidency, he was a leader of the American Revolution that achieved independence from Great Britain and served as the first vice president of the United States. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in early American history, including his wife and adviser, Abigail. His letters and other papers serve as an important source of historical information about the era. A lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre. Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States' own constitution, as did his earlier Thoughts on Government. Adams was elected to two terms as vice president under President George Washington and was elected as the United States' second president in 1796. He was the first, and only, president elected under the banner of the Federalist Party. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts and built up the Army and Navy in the undeclared Quasi-War with France. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the White House. In his bid for reelection, opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Republicans led to Adams's loss to his former friend Thomas Jefferson, and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family, which includes their son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. John Adams died on July 4, 1826 – the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence – hours after Jefferson's death. Surveys of historians and scholars have favorably ranked his administration.

62,"Alexandre Sacha Gaydamak (born May 1976 in France) is a French and Israeli businessman. A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be £32,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent £2.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.

Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 – April 21, 1910), known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, entrepreneur, publisher, and lecturer. He was lauded as the greatest humorist this country has produced, and William Faulkner called him the father of American literature. His novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), the latter often called The Great American Novel. Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter, contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens. He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. His humorous story, The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, was published in 1865, based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a miner. The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French. His wit and satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty. Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures, but he invested in ventures that lost most of it—such as the Paige Compositor, a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision. He filed for bankruptcy in the wake of these financial setbacks, but he eventually overcame his financial troubles with the help of Henry Huttleston Rogers. He eventually paid all his creditors in full, even though his bankruptcy relieved him of having to do so. Twain was born shortly after an appearance of Halley's Comet, and he predicted that he would go out with it as well; he died the day after the comet returned.

Lisa Christina Siwe( born 17 August 1968) is an award- winning Swedish director from Tynnered, Gothenburg. She studied directing at Dramatiska Institutet in Stockholm and graduated in 1999. As part of her studies there, Siwe directed the 30- minute short film Födelsedagar och andra katastrofer( starring Swedish actress Sissela Kyle). It was well received and won her many awards, both in and outside of Sweden. As a result, she was able to get a job at the production studio Madstone Pictures in New York City. Siwe was hired along with three other directors, and the studio's plan was that each of them would direct their own film. However, only one of them was able to follow through because he had already begun working on his project before he got the job at Madstone. Although she felt that she learned a lot while working at the studio, Siwe decided to return to Sweden to further her career. After reading the 2003 novel I taket lyser stjärnorna one night, Siwe received the idea to adapt it into a film. She approached Linn Gottfridsson, a friend she met at Dramatiska Institutet, about the idea. They eventually decided the Siwe should direct the film and Gottfridsson should write it. Once they had acquired the rights from the author of the novel, production began. The film, distributed internationally as Glowing Stars, was released in Sweden on 30 January 2009. It marked Siwe's feature- length film debut.  Glowing Stars was critically acclaimed and won several awards. Siwe won a Guldbagge Award, the most prestigious film award in Sweden, in the Best Director category for directing the film. Recently, she headed Modus for SvTV, which had the largest TV audience in Swedish TV history on its premiere. Modus 2 just premiered in Sweden. She is currently living at Södermalm in Stockholm.

What is the place of birth of Gwilym Lloyd George's father?",criccieth,manchester,0.14473116397857666,0.0,False
131,"Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby, (4 December 1894 – 14 February 1967) was a British politician and cabinet minister. The younger son of Prime Minister David Lloyd George, he served as Home Secretary from 1954 to 1957.

Richard Lloyd George, 2nd Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor (15 February 1889 – 1 May 1968) was a British soldier and peer in the peerage of the United Kingdom, a member of the House of Lords from 1945 until his death. The son of the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George by his first wife, Margaret Owen, Lloyd George was educated at Portmadoc School and Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1910. During the First World War he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers and rose to the rank of Major. He became an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and served in the British Army again during the Second World War. On 7 April 1917 Lloyd George married Roberta McAlpine (1898–1966), a daughter of Sir Robert McAlpine, 1st Baronet. They had two children, Valerie Davidia (1918–2000) and Owen (1924–2010), before being divorced in 1933. In 1935 Lloyd George married secondly Winifred Emily Peedle, a daughter of Thomas W. Peedle. Valerie became the wife of the academic and broadcasting executive, Sir Goronwy Daniel. On 1 January 1945 his father was created Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, and he gained the courtesy title of Viscount Gwynedd. Less than three months later, on 26 March 1945, his father died of cancer and he inherited his peerage, unusually becoming the first member of the family to sit in the House of Lords, as David Lloyd George had been too ill to do so. He wrote a biography of his mother, Dame Margaret, and of his father, Lloyd George.

David Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, (17 January 1863 – 26 March 1945) was a British statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1916 and 1922. He was the final Liberal to hold the post. Lloyd George was born in Manchester to Welsh parents. His father—a schoolmaster—died in 1864 and he was raised in Wales by his mother and her shoemaker brother, whose Liberal politics and Baptist faith strongly influenced Lloyd George; the same uncle helped the boy embark on a career as a solicitor after leaving school. Lloyd George became active in local politics, gaining a reputation as an orator and a proponent of a Welsh blend of radical Liberalism which championed nonconformism and the disestablishment of the Anglican church in Wales, equality for labourers and tenant farmers, and reform of landownership. In 1890, he narrowly won a by-election to become the Member of Parliament for Caernarvon Boroughs, in which seat he remained for fifty-five years. Lloyd George served in Henry Campbell-Bannerman's cabinet from 1905. After H. H. Asquith succeeded to the premiership in 1908, Lloyd George replaced him as Chancellor of the Exchequer. To fund extensive welfare reforms, he proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the People's Budget (1909), which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected. The resulting constitutional crisis was only resolved after two elections in 1910 and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. His budget was then enacted alongside the National Insurance Act 1911 which helped to establish the modern welfare state. In 1913, he was embroiled in the Marconi scandal but he remained in office and struggled to impose Irish Home Rule until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 suspended its implementation. As wartime Chancellor, Lloyd George strengthened the country's finances and forged agreements with trade unions to maintain production. In 1915, Asquith formed a Liberal-led wartime coalition with the Conservatives and Labour. Lloyd George became Minister of Munitions and rapidly expanded production. In 1916, he was appointed Secretary of State for War but was frustrated by his limited power and clashes with the military establishment over strategy. Amid stalemate on the Western Front, confidence in Asquith's leadership waned. He was forced to resign in December 1916; Lloyd George succeeded him as Prime Minister, supported by the Conservatives and some Liberals. He centralised authority through a smaller war cabinet, a new Cabinet Office and his Garden Suburb of advisers. To combat food shortages he implemented the convoy system, established rationing, and stimulated farming. After supporting the disastrous French Nivelle Offensive in 1917, he had to reluctantly approve Field Marshal Haig's plans for the Battle of Passchendaele which resulted in huge casualities with little strategic benefit. Against the views of his commanders, he was finally able to see the Allies brought under one command in March 1918. The war effort turned to their favour that August and was won in November. In the aftermath, he and the Conservatives maintained their coalition with popular support following the December 1918 Coupon election. His government had extended the franchise to all men and some women earlier in the year. Lloyd George was a major player in Paris Peace Conference of 1919 but the situation in Ireland worsened that year, erupting into the Irish War of Independence which lasted until Lloyd George negotiated independence for the Irish Free State in 1921. At home he initiated reforms to education and housing but trade union militancy entered record levels, the economy became depressed in 1920 and unemployment rose; spending cuts followed (1921–22) and he was embroiled in a scandal over the sale of honours and the Chanak Crisis in 1922. Bonar Law won backbench support for the Conservatives to contend the next election alone. Lloyd George resigned; with his party split between his and Asquith's supporters, his faction won less than 60 seats in the 1922 election. The next year the pair reunited to oppose Stanley Baldwin's tariff proposal which he put to the country. The Liberals made gains in 1923 but remained third after the Conservatives and Labour, propping up a Labour minority government; they never regained their status as second party and, when the Labour government fell, went down to just over 40 seats in 1924 under Asquith. Lloyd George led the Liberals from 1926 to 1931, putting forward innovative proposals for public works; this failed to convert into seats in 1929 and from 1931 he was a marginalised and mistrusted figure heading a small rump of breakaway Liberals opposed to the National Government. He declined an offer to serve in Winston Churchill's War Cabinet in 1940 and was raised to the peerage in 1945, shortly before his death. Lloyd George has often been ranked highly among modern British prime ministers, but his legacy remains complicated and controversial. Scholars have praised his welfare reforms and his efforts to mobilise and lead Britain to victory during the First World War, but he has also been criticised for adopting a presidential style of leadership, for distrusting his own commanders during the war, and for his strategic failures and involvement in various scandals. His legacies over Ireland and the Treaty of Versailles are also controversial. In the post-war period, he arguably alienated many of the workers he had earlier championed, helping to swell Labour's popular support at the Liberals' expense (not helped by his conflicts with Asquithian Liberals after 1916).

Fuqua began his career directing music videos for popular artists such as Toni Braxton, Coolio, Stevie Wonder and Prince. From 1998 onwards, he began directing feature films. Fuqua has expressed his early respect for Akira Kurosawa as a filmmaker and written about how Kurosawa influenced his own perspective on filmmaking.

Born in Tokyo, Japan, he attended Waseda University but left before graduating due to his involvement in a left- wing theater troupe. He joined P.C.L.( a precursor to Toho) in 1933 and began working as an assistant director to Kajir Yamamoto alongside his longtime friend, acclaimed Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa. He made his feature film directing debut in 1947 with Snow Trail, which was written by Kurosawa.  Snow Trail starred Toshir Mifune in his film debut and actress Setsuko Wakayama.

Leonora was born in Florence, where she was brought up by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Eleanor of Toledo, her aunt and namesake. Betrothed to their son Pietro at the age of 15, she blossomed under the wing of Pietro's older sister, the artistic patron Isabella, into a vivacious and witty beauty. Her marriage, like Isabella's, was not a success, and she followed her mentor's example of taking lovers. For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it. Until recently, little was known of Leonora di Garzia di Toledo, and she was not identified as the sitter of several portraits of her. The facts of her life have emerged from the growing scholarship on Isabella de' Medici, with whom she has much in common.

What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?",hranice,wales,0.0889718309044838,0.0,False
193,"Eiludd Powys was an early 7th-century King of Powys. One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf Sarffgadau ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.

Beli ap Eiludd was a 7th- century King of Powys. Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. It is more likely however that as the genealogies state he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf, the former being the most likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw painting the Mathrafal dynasty as being descendants of Selyf. It was also likely if Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.

Maredudd ap Bleddyn (1047 – 9 February 1132) was a prince and later King of Powys in eastern Wales. Maredudd was the son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn who was King of both Powys and Gwynedd. When Bleddyn was killed in 1075, Powys was divided between three of his sons, Iorwerth, Cadwgan and Maredudd.

Luis Vélez de Guevara( born Luis Vélez de Santander) ( 1 August 1579 – 10 November 1644) was a Spanish dramatist and novelist. He was born at Écija and was of Jewish converso descent. After graduating as a sizar at the University of Osuna in 1596, he joined the household of Rodrigo de Castro, Cardinal- Archbishop of Seville, and celebrated the marriage of Philip III in a poem signed Vélez de Santander, a name which he continued to use till some years later. It seems he served as a soldier in Italy and Algiers, returning to Spain in 1602 when he entered the service of the count de Saldaña, and dedicated himself to writing for the stage. He died at Madrid on 10 November 1644. Velez de Guevara was the author of over four hundred plays, of which the best are Reinar despues de morirLa Luna de la Sierra, and El Diablo está en Cantillana. The play Más pesa el rey que la sangre, which translates into The King weighs more than blood( kinship) is based on the episode of the Reconquista in which the nobleman Alonso Pérez de Guzmán allows his son to be sacrificed, rather than surrender his King's possession of Tarifa. However, Vélez de Guevara is most widely known as the author of El diablo cojuelo( 1641, The Lame Devil or The Crippled Devil), a fantastic novel which suggested to Alain- René Lesage the idea for Le Diable boiteux( 1707). The plot presents a rascal student that hides in an astrologer's mansard. He frees a devil from a bottle. As an acknowledgement the devil shows him the apartments of Madrid and the tricks, miseries and mischiefs of their inhabitants. A similar theme was suggested by the magic lenses in Los anteojos de mejor vista( 1620 – 1625) by Rodrigo Fernández de Ribera. Charles Dickens refers to El Diablo cojuelo in The Old Curiosity Shop, chapter thirty- three.

He also wrote, in collaboration, Amor vencido de Amor (with Juan de Zabaleta and Antonio de la Huerta); La verdad en el engaño (with Jerónimo de Cáncer and Martínez de Meneses); the burlesque Los siete infantes de Lara (1650, with Jerónimo de Cáncer); and La cortesana en la sierra and El hidalgo de La Mancha (with Juan Bautista Diamante and Juan de Matos Fragoso).

214,"George Orson Welles( May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, writer and producer who is remembered for his innovative work in radio, theatre and film. He is considered one of the greatest film directors of all time. While in his twenties Welles directed a number of high- profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project, including an adaptation of Macbeth with an entirely African American cast and the political musical The Cradle Will Rock. In 1937 he and John Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941, including Caesar( 1937), a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. In 1938, his radio anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air gave Welles the platform to find international fame as the director and narrator of a radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds, which caused widespread panic because many listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring. Although some contemporary sources say these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to notoriety. His first film was Citizen Kane( 1941), which is consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made, which he co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles released twelve other features, the most acclaimed of which include The Magnificent Ambersons( 1942), The Lady from Shanghai( 1947), Touch of Evil( 1958), The Trial( 1962), Chimes at Midnight( 1966) and F for Fake( 1973). Welles was an outsider to the studio system, and struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios in Hollywood and later in life with a variety of independent financiers across Europe, where he spent most of his career. Many of his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. Some, like Touch of Evil, have been painstakingly re-edited from his notes. With a development spanning almost 50 years, Welles's final film, The Other Side of the Wind, was released in 2018. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots and long takes. He has been praised as the ultimate auteur. Welles had three marriages, including one with Rita Hayworth, and three children. Known for his baritone voice, Welles performed extensively across theatre, radio and film. He was a lifelong magician noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years. In 2002 he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics. He was also included in the list of the 50 greatest Hollywood actors of all time by The Telegraph UK.

Ashok Mehta( 1947 – 15 August 2012) was a noted national film award- winning Indian film cinematographer, known for films such as Bandit Queen( 1994), 36 Chowringhee Lane( 1981) and Utsav( 1984). He won the National Film Award for Best Cinematography twice, 36 Chowringhee Lane( 1981) and Moksha( 2000), the latter he also directed. He worked both with directors of mainstream Bollywood, like Subhash Ghai( Ram Lakhan( 1989), Saudagar( 1991)) and Rajiv Rai(( 1997)), Mukul Anand( Trimurti( 1995)), as well as parallel cinema directors, like Shyam Benegal( Trikaal( 1985), Mandi( 1983)), Aparna Sen( 36 Chowringhee Lane( 1981), Paroma( 1984)). He also worked on films, including Shekhar Kapoor's Bandit Queen( 1994), Girish Karnad's Utsav( 1984), Gulzar's Ijaazat( 1987) and MF Hussain's Gaja Gamini( 2000). Early in 2012, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. While he was getting treated for Lung cancer, he was diagnosed with brain tumor. Despite the surgery and cancer, he never stopped working as movies and cinematography was his passion and first love. He succumbed to cancer in Mumbai on 15 August 2012, at the age of 64. Ashok Mehta's journey is a rags to riches story. He ran away from home at the age of 14 and came to Mumbai. With no money, no acquaintance and no shelter he had nowhere to go and to survive he started selling stuff like boiled eggs, fruits etc. His Journey in the Bollywood started as a canteen boy, office boy and then a camera attendant. After a decade- long struggle in the Indian film industry, he finally became the DOP. He got his first break as a cinematographer at the age of 25 in Raj Marbros' The Witness. He credits his actual career boost to the reigning star of the 1970s, Shashi Kapoor. Kapoor, who was starring in a film being shot by Mehta, was greatly impressed by his work and even though the film did not get made eventually, it won Mehta the favor of Kapoor, who offered him his next production, 36 Chowringhee Lane. The next step for Mehta was to establish himself in mainstream cinema and this opportunity came through actress Rakhee. It was during the filming of Paroma that Rakhee got acquainted with Mehta and his work, but it was years later when Subhash Ghai, leading director of the popular film scene, was on the lookout for a cameraman for his mega-project Ram Lakhan, that she suggested the name of Mehta. Ashok Mehta then stepped onto the popular film scene and with the collaboration of Ghai, brought to popular cinema an altogether different style of lighting and shot taking. He is lovingly known as the guiding light in Bollywood.  Moksha, also known as Moksha: Salvation, is a 2001 release. Ashok Mehta launched Arjun Rampal in Bollywood with this movie.

He started his career, assisting Raj Khosla in Milap( 1955), C.I.D.( 1956) and Solva Saal( 1958), before making his directorial debut with Ek Phool Char Kaante starring Sunil Dutt and Waheeda Rehman. He died on 5 September 2001, while undergoing a heart bypass surgery at Nanavati Hospital, in Mumbai, at the age of 73.

Where did the director of film Ręce Do Góry study?",unknown,national film school in łódź,0.04335886240005493,0.0,False
218,"Rce do góry (known in its subtitled English version as Hands Up!) is a Polish drama film directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. It is the fourth of a series of semi-autobiographical films in which Skolimowski himself plays his alter ego, Andrzej Leszczyc. At the time it was banned in Poland, under the Communist regime, for 18 years because it depicted the Stalinist past. The film was originally made in 1967 in monochrome by studio. In a twenty-minute section (filmed in colour) added by Skolimowski in 1981 he explains how the original was withheld by Polish censors of the time, and that this was a principal cause of his leaving his country; however following liberalisation in Poland, he was invited to resuscitate it. The introduction includes, apart from some fictional apocalyptic passages, shots of Beirut ruined by the civil wars of the 1970s, where Skolimowski is working as an actor on Volker Schloendorff's German film Die Fälschung (Circle of Deceit), and also shots of London featuring demonstrations in favour of Solidarnosc, Speaker's Corner, and an exhibition of Skolimowski's own paintings. These sections include cameo roles by Bruno Ganz, David Essex, Mike Sarne and others. Some of the music in this introduction is from the 1970 choral work Kosmogonia by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. The original film is a surrealistic reunion of Leszczyc (who has apparently become a veterinary surgeon) and some of his student colleagues. They refer to themselves by the makes of the cars they own - Leszczyc owns a Zastawa, one owns a Wartburg, the others own more upmarket models such as an Opel Rekord or the Alfa Romeo owned by the unhappily married couple. Supposedly taking speed (although it is later revealed the pills are a placebo), and carousing in the cattle truck of a freight train, the group offers various satirical sidelights on Polish society of the 1960s. The characters also reflect that the truck may have been one of those in which the former generation were transported during World War II to the Nazi death camps. The final credits show the actors as they are in 1981, with the exception of Bogumil Kobiela, who died in 1969. The film was screened out of competition at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.

Nora Bernard( September 22, 1935 – December 26, 2007) was a Canadian Mi'kmaq activist who sought compensation for survivors of the Canadian Indian residential school system. She was directly responsible for what became the largest class- action lawsuit in Canadian history, representing an estimated 79,000 survivors; the Canadian government settled the lawsuit in 2005 for upwards of 5 billion dollars. In 1945, when Bernard was 9 years old, her mother was told that if she did not sign the consent forms to send her children to a residential school, the child welfare system would take her children into protective custody; as a result, Bernard attended the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for five years. In 1955, she married a non-native man, and consequently lost her legal status under the Indian Act; the relevant section of the Indian Act was repealed in 1985, but this did not automatically lead to reinstatement as a band member, and it was not until March 2007 that she was voted back into the Millbrook First Nation. In 1995, Bernard began an organization to represent survivors of the Shubenacadie school; she subsequently convinced Halifax lawyer John McKiggan to represent the Shubenacadie survivors in a class- action suit. After the Shubenacadie suit became public knowledge, many other survivors' associations across Canada filed similar suits; these were eventually amalgamated into one national lawsuit. In McKiggan's words, if it was n't for Nora's efforts, and other survivors like her across Canada, this national settlement never would have happened. After we filed our lawsuit, a number of other students from other schools filed similar class actions. In 2005, she testified before the House of Commons of Canada about the abuse children suffered in residential schools: On December 27, 2007, Bernard was found dead in her home in Truro, Nova Scotia; although she was originally thought to have died of natural causes, on December 31, police arrested her grandson James Douglas Gloade and charged him with her murder. She had been stabbed to death. On January 23, 2009, Gloade was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison. In 2008 Bernard was posthumously awarded the Order of Nova Scotia.

235,"Hunter is a song recorded by Icelandic musician Björk for her third studio album Homogenic (1997). The lyrics explore the pressure Björk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The song was first performed at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later included with the online promotional release of Homogenic; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Björk and Mark Bell, Hunter features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission. Most music critics were enticed by Hunter, which they declared one of the highlights of the Homogenic album. The single charted poorly, peaking at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart and number 55 on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. The accompanying music video for Hunter was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Björk as she transforms into a techno-bear while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics. Björk has performed Hunter on  Later... with Jools Holland and in five of her tours, the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour.

Georgiana Somerset, Marchioness of Worcester (3 October 1792 – 11 May 1821), formerly Georgiana Frederica Fitzroy, was the first wife of Henry Somerset, 7th Duke of Beaufort, but died prior to his inheriting the dukedom. Georgiana was a daughter of the Hon. Henry FitzRoy, a son of Lord Southampton, and his wife, Lady Anne Wellesley, a sister of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Following the death of Georgiana's father, her mother married Charles Culling Smith and had a daughter and a son. She married the future duke on 25 July 1814, when he was known as Marquess of Worcester. He had been a junior officer under her uncle, the Duke of Wellington, who gave Georgiana away at the wedding. The following week, the marquess's uncle, Lord FitzRoy Somerset, married another of Wellington's nieces, Lady Emily Harriet Wellesley-Pole; she was also given away by the duke. Georgiana was a friend of Princess Charlotte of Wales (died 1817), the daughter of the Prince of Wales (the future King George IV of the United Kingdom), and her engagement to Somerset was announced at a ball given by the prince at Carlton House.

Her virtues were inherent in her character; every day developed them more and more, and they were such as to make the happiness of all who lived with her and to captivate the affection of all who really knew her. The Journal of Harriet Arbuthnot notes: She was only 28, one of the handsomest women in England, had made the most brilliant marriage and was flattered, followed and admired by all the world. It is sad to contrast all this brilliancy with the cold and dreary grave that will so soon close over her; and yet she will then have more tranquility, for her prospects were not happy ones. Lord Worcester, overwhelmed with debts, had lately had executions in his house and, if the Duke of Wellington had not given her rooms in his house, she would not have had a hole to put her head into. . . . . Her deathbed was attended by wild exhibitions of grief from many of her female friends, who were distraught by the great pain she endured. Her last words were I never thought death could hurt so much. A year after the death of his wife, on 29 June 1822, the Marquess of Worcester married her younger half-sister, Emily Frances Smith. Under church law, the proximity of the relationship meant that the marriage could have been voided during the couple's lifetime; this was one of several cases that led to changes in the law under the Marriage Act 1836. The marriage led to a bitter quarrel between the Duke of Wellington, who opposed it and his sister Anne, Emily and Georgiana's mother, who supported it, and they were never close again.

Tomás Gutiérrez Alea (December 11, 1928 – April 16, 1996) was a Cuban filmmaker. He wrote and directed more than 20 features, documentaries, and short films, which are known for his sharp insight into post-Revolutionary Cuba, and possess a delicate balance between dedication to the revolution and criticism of the social, economic, and political conditions of the country. Gutiérrez's work is representative of a cinematic movement occurring in the 1960s and 1970s known collectively as the New Latin American Cinema. This collective movement, also referred to by various writers by specific names such as “Third Cinema”, “Cine Libre”, and “Imperfect Cinema,” was concerned largely with the problems of neocolonialism and cultural identity. The movement rejected both the commercial perfection of the Hollywood style, and the auteur-oriented European art cinema, for a cinema created as a tool for political and social change. Due not in a small part to the filmmakers’ lack of resources, aesthetic was of secondary importance to cinema's social function. The movement's main goal was to create films in which the viewer became an active, self-aware participant in the discourse of the film. Viewers were presented with an analysis of a current problem within society that as of that time had no clear solution, hoping to make the audience aware of the problem and to leave the theater willing to become actors of social change.

Eleanor of England (18 June 1269 – 29 August 1298) was an English princess, the eldest surviving daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen Eleanor of Castile. What evidence exists for Eleanor's early years suggests that while her parents were absent on Crusade between 1270 and 1274, she became very close to her paternal grandmother, Eleanor of Provence, with whom she continued to spend a good deal of time. She was also close to her sickly brother Henry. On one Pentecost Eve, Henry and Eleanor were given two partridges for their dinner, for a special treat. For a long period Eleanor was betrothed to King Alfonso III of Aragon. Alfonso's parents were under papal interdict, however, because of their claims to the throne of Sicily, which were contrary to the papal donation of the Sicilian throne to Charles I of Naples, and despite the Aragonese ruler's repeated pleas that Edward I send his daughter to them for marriage, Edward refused to send her as long as the interdict remained in place. In 1282 he declined one such request by saying that his wife and mother felt the girl, who had just turned 13, was too young to be married, and that they wanted to wait another two years before sending her to Aragon. Alfonso died before the marriage could take place. Eleanor subsequently married the French nobleman, Henry III, Count of Bar on September 20, 1293, and had two children: According to Kenneth Panton, Eleanor is credited with a daughter called Eleanor (b.1285), who supposedly married a Welshman named Llywelyn ap Owain. She died at Ghent on 29 August 1298. Eleanor was buried in Westminster Abbey but the location of her grave in the Abbey is unknown.

265,"Joan of Châtillon (Jeanne de Blois; 1253? – 19 or 29 January 1291) was Countess of Blois from 1280 to 1291, and Lady of Avesnes. She was the daughter of John I, Count of Blois and Alix of Brittany, Dame de Pontarcy. Joan received the County of Chartres from her father during his life; she later sold these lands to Philip IV of France in 1286. She ceded the lordship of Avesnes to her cousin Hugh before her death. When she died in 1291 the other titles were left to him also. In 1263, Joanne married Peter of Alençon, a son of King Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence. They had two sons who both died in infancy: Joan died in 1291, with no living issue. She left the title of Count of Blois and her remaining titles to her cousin Hugh.

She was the eldest daughter of John I, Duke of Brittany and Blanche of Navarre, daughter of Theobald I of Navarre and Agnes of Beaujeu. Alix held the title Dame de Pontarcy in her own right. Sometime after a contract was signed on 11 December 1254, she married John I, Count of Blois of the House of Châtillon. Thereafter she was styled Countess of Blois. She brought as her dowry her titles of Pontarcy and de Brie-Comte-Robert, which had been named after her ancestor Robert I of Dreux. The marriage produced one child, a daughter Jeanne, who was heiress to her father's title and estates. In 1270, her husband was appointed Lieutenant General of France. Through Alix's marriage to John, the Château de Brie-Comte-Robert passed to the Châtillon family. Alix and John founded several religious houses including the Monastery of La Guiche near Blois in 1277. She became a widow on 28 June 1279. In 1287, the year before her own death, Alix travelled to Palestine. From there she journeyed on to Syria, where she commissioned the erection of two barbican towers at Ptolemais.

267,"Sancho Ramírez (before 10431105/November 1110) was an illegitimate son of King Ramiro I of Aragon and Amuña, the firstborn and brother of his namesake who would inherit the throne and reign as Sancho Ramírez.

Ramiro Sánchez of Monzón (1070–1129/1130) was a noble kinsman of the kings of Navarre. In 1104 he was tenente of Urroz, of Monzón between 1104 and 1116, probably of Tudela in 1117 and from 1122 to 1129 in Erro. His father was Sancho Garcés, an illegitimate son of king García Sánchez III of Navarre. His mother was Constance, whose parentage has been subject to recent speculation - associated with the lords of Marañón in traditional sources, she has lately been suggested to have been daughter of queen Estefanía, King García's wife, and hence stepsister of her husband. With the fall of his uncle, king Sancho IV of Navarre, the kingdom was divided between Castile and Aragon, and the royal family parceled out between the two. Ramiro was thus raised at the Aragonese court, and was lord of Monzón, in which he was succeeded by his eldest son, the future king García Ramírez of Navarre. Around 1098, Ramiro was married to Cristina Rodríguez daughter of Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar. Their children were:

Sancho Ramírez (1042 – 4 June, 1094) was King of Aragon from 1063 until 1094 and King of Pamplona from 1076 under the name of Sancho V . He was the eldest son of Ramiro I and Ermesinda of Bigorre. His father was the first king of Aragon and an illegitimate son of Sancho III of Pamplona. He inherited the Aragonese crown from his father in 1063. Sancho Ramírez was chosen king of Pamplona by Navarrese noblemen after Sancho IV was murdered by his siblings.

It was filmed in Seattle, Washington, site of the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. The governor of Washington at the time, Albert Rosellini, suggested the setting to Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer executives. The film made$ 2.25 million at the box office.

State Fair is a 1962 American musical film directed by José Ferrer and starring Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Ann-Margret, Tom Ewell, Pamela Tiffin and Alice Faye. A remake of the 1933 film State Fair and the 1945 State Fair films, it was considered to be a financially and critically unsuccessful film. Richard Rodgers wrote additional songs, both music and lyrics, for this 1962 version of the novel to film adaptation. His partner, Oscar Hammerstein, had died in 1960. While the 1933 and 1945 versions were set at the Iowa State Fair, this 1962 version was set in Texas (the family drives through Dallas where the State Fair of Texas is held). It was filmed on soundstages at Twentieth Century Fox in California, at various locations in Texas, at Mooney's Grove park in Visalia, California, and the climactic speedway sequence was filmed on location at the Oklahoma State Fair Raceway in Oklahoma City where the Oklahoma State Fair is held.. The Tilt-A-Whirl that was used in the film is currently at a small theme park in Golden, Colorado. The novel State Fair would be dramatized twice more following the 1962 film. The first State Fair stage musical, which utilized a variety of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs (many originally written for projects not related to their State Fair film), was first produced in 1969. A revised version of this stage musical was produced in the 1990s and eventually played on Broadway. A non-musical version of State Fair was filmed for televsion in 1976.

The IND World's Fair Line, officially the World's Fair Railroad, was a temporary branch of the Independent Subway System( IND) serving the 1939 New York World's Fair in Queens, New York City. It split from the IND Queens Boulevard Line at an existing flying junction east of Forest Hills – 71st Avenue station, ran through the Jamaica Yard and then ran northeast and north through Flushing Meadows – Corona Park, roughly along the current path of the Van Wyck Expressway. The line continued along a wooden trestle to the World's Fair Railroad Station, located slightly south of Horace Harding Boulevard( now the Long Island Expressway). The World's Fair station, the only one on the line, consisted of two tracks and three platforms. The line was planned beginning in 1936, and it was constructed in 1938. The line and station were only open in 1939 and 1940 during the Fair's operating season. Passengers had to pay a ten- cent fare to use this line, double the subway's standard five- cent fare. This was not the only line to serve the world's fair. The Interborough Rapid Transit and the Brooklyn Manhattan Transit operated service to the Fair via the World's Fair station of their joint- operated IRT Flushing Line. The World's Fair Railroad and station are the only IND line and station to have been closed and demolished. Remnants of the line are still present in the Jamaica Yard.

269,"Lolita is a song recorded by American singer Leah LaBelle. It was released on May 7, 2013 through Epic. The single was written by American songwriter Kelly Sheehan in collaboration with record producer Pharrell Williams. Backed by synthesizers and a bass guitar, it is a midtempo funk, R&B, and pop song with disco influences. Media commentators have suggested the song was inspired by Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel Lolita, and noted that its lyrics greatly diverge from the source material.

The single ranked number seven on the Dance Club Songs Billboard chart in the United States. Internationally, it peaked at number 264 on the official Tophit airplay chart. To promote Lolita, LaBelle sang an acoustic version for Rap-Up, and performed the original version at various venues, such as New York Fashion Week and the Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend. Directed by Diane Martel, the single's accompanying music video features LaBelle as Lolita and shows how she seduces boys from her neighborhood. The video received attention due to its focus on sexuality. Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church strongly criticized Martel's creation of sexually-explicit music videos, and Idolator selected the carwash scene as an instance in which the video emphasized sexuality. Despite the criticism, LaBelle's performance garnered positive reviews.

At the age of sixteen she was sent to Cincinnati, Ohio to live with her cousins and finish her education. She trained to be a teacher and taught kindergarten in 1883. However, Smith found that the physical demands of working with children were too strenuous for her. Due to back problems, she had difficulty bending down to their level. Persuaded to attend one of her friend's or cousin's art classes, Smith realized she had a talent for drawing.

Smith was born on September 25, 1968 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr., a U.S. Air Force veteran and refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen.

She was adopted by the Smiths. Her birth mother died giving birth to Julia and her twin brother Joseph, so their birth father John Murdock offered them to Smith and his wife, who themselves had lost prematurely born twins the same day. After Joseph and Emma Smith had taken custody of the children, in late March 1832, the infant Joseph became ill. Consequently Emma decided to have the babies sleep separately to prevent a spread of the disease. Joseph Smith had taken baby Joseph to bed with him and Emma was in the other room with Julia.

Julia returned to Nauvoo and lived with her mother until November 19, 1856, when she married John J. Middleton, a local farmer. They moved to St Louis Missouri shortly after that for employment. It was a difficult time for his employment and their marriage. Middleton was a devout Catholic, and Julia was baptized into the Catholic Church on November 9, 1857. In 1876, Julia moved back to Nauvoo, after her husband left her and went west. She lived with her mother at the Riverside Mansion, the brick home Emma's second husband Major Lewis C.

Friday the 13th is a 2009 American slasher film directed by Marcus Nispel and written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift from a screen story by Shannon, Swift and Mark Wheaton. It is a reboot of the Friday the 13th film series, which began in 1980. Nispel also directed the 2003 remake of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre( 1974), while Shannon and Swift wrote the screenplay for the 2003 crossover Freddy vs. Jason.

The film was originally conceived as an origin story, but the project evolved into a re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes.  Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.  Friday the 13th was theatrically released in the United States on February 13, 2009, by New Line Cinema in North American territories and by Paramount Pictures internationally.

278,"Children Underground is an American 2001 documentary film directed by Edet Belzberg. In an effort to increase the Romanian work force, former communist leader Nicolae Ceauescu outlawed contraception and abortion in 1966. Thousands of unwanted children were placed in state orphanages where they faced terrible conditions. With the fall of Communism, many children from the orphanages moved into the streets while others were runaways from impoverished families. Today there are 20,000 children living in the streets while the resources for sheltering these homeless youths are severely limited.  Children Underground follows the story of five street children, aged eight to sixteen who live in a subway station in Bucharest, Romania. The street kids are encountered daily by commuting adults, who pass them by in the station as they starve, swindle, and steal, all while searching desperately for a fresh can of paint to get high with. Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintain their distance as the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, watching dispassionately as the youngsters inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags. In a slightly uplifting coda, Belzberg and crew return a year later to find that a police who swept off the Victoriei has dispersed the children. Some of them landed in state- funded homes, while others simply moved on to one of the many abandoned construction sites that dot the city. Belzberg steers away from any discussion of the rampant sexual exploitation of these young children or the fact that one of the biggest dangers they face are STDs, including AIDS, but the urban hell she presents is shattering enough. Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants in the world's wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate. One of the children director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu. At first, this child looked like a young man, but one later finds out that girls have to become tough and look boyish in order to survive. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta' Macarena' Rosu, who is also a girl. The nickname' Macarena' derives from the song Macarena, her favorite. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled. The film explores the lives of these children, who are shown fighting, abusing themselves, and becoming addicted to Aurolac. The filmmakers follow Mihai to his family's home in the town of Constana. A similar scene films Ana and Marian as they visit their home, which is also outside Bucharest.

Prior to its release date, Pharoahe Monch's independent label, W.A.R. Media, published a visual trailer to YouTube on September 22, 2012. The song was officially made available for purchase worldwide on September 27, 2012, on the iTunes Music Store by W.A.R. Media in conjunction with Duck Down Music Inc.. The Lee Stone-produced song is the final piece to Pharoahe's bullet trilogy in which he anthropomorphizes a slug fired with the intent to annihilate, and tackles the issue of gun violence. The song and its provide a chilling reminder that bullets have no name.

Rape is the fourth track on Internal Affairs, the debut album of Queens rapper Pharoahe Monch. Allmusic critic Steve Huey says in his review Monch lives up to his reputation as one of hip-hop's most technically skilled MCs. Nowhere is this balancing act more evident than on Rape, a rather disquieting extended metaphor for his mastery of hip-hop (other MCs just ain't fuckin' it right Primarily, the song is a satirical response to rapper Common's classic I Used to Love H.E.R., a nostalgic song that features a feminized personification of hip-hop as a lost love that has fallen to vice. Pharoahe Monch's more graphic and violent rendition is accordingly a critique of the vapid state of contemporary mainstream hip-hop, conveyed from the perspective of a variously passionate or obsessed rapist, equally infatuated by hip-hop as a woman. As Huey points out, Rape equally is an extended metaphor for Pharoahe's technical mastery of hip-hop. Personification and extended metaphor are techniques widely employed by hip-hop lyricists. In fact this very song is developed from a theme that is found in a Pharoahe Monch verse five years earlier.  Thirteen, a song from the 1994 Organized Konfusion album , contains the following excerpt from Pharoahe's verse:

The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel City of Night and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf.  My Own Private Idaho had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly. The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million.

He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Howard was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. A bookish and intellectual child, he was also a fan of boxing and spent some time in his late teens bodybuilding, eventually taking up amateur boxing. From the age of nine he dreamed of becoming a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard's writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death. Although a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard's stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was Weird Tales, where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly-read author, with his best works still reprinted. Howard's suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis his entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was not expected to wake, he walked out to his car and shot himself in the head.

Conan Christopher O'Brien (born April 18, 1963) is an American television host, comedian, writer, podcaster, and producer. He is best known for hosting several late-night talk shows; since 2010, he has hosted Conan on the cable channel TBS. Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, O'Brien was raised in an Irish Catholic family. He served as president of The Harvard Lampoon while attending Harvard University, and was a writer for the sketch comedy series  Not Necessarily the News. After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of Saturday Night Live. O'Brien was a writer and producer for The Simpsons for two seasons until he was commissioned by NBC to take over David Letterman's position as host of Late Night in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial Late Night tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien relocated from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of The Tonight Show for seven months until network politics prompted a host change in 2010. Known for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as awkward, self-deprecating humor, O'Brien's late-night programs combine the lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes). He has hosted Conan since 2010 and has also hosted such events as the Emmy Awards and Christmas in Washington. O'Brien has been the subject of a documentary, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop (2011), and has also hosted a 32-city live comedy tour and later an 18-city live comedy tour. With the retirement of David Letterman on May 20, 2015, O'Brien became the longest-working of all current late-night talk show hosts in the United States, at 25 years.

Are The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 Film) and Man On Wire both from the same country?",no,yes,0.3410777449607849,0.0,False
290,"The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1956 American suspense thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, starring James Stewart and Doris Day. The film is Hitchcock's second film using this title following his own 1934 film of the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. In the book- length interview Hitchcock/ Truffaut( 1967), in response to fellow filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional. The film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Que Sera, Sera( Whatever Will Be, Will Be), sung by Doris Day. It premiered at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival on April 29.

The Girl Who Knew Too Much is a 1969 neo noir film starring Adam West as Johnny Cain, a nightclub owner and former freelance adventurer who is forced out of retirement when a crime syndicate boss is murdered in his nightclub and investigations lead into unexpected areas. It was the final film of director Francis D. Lyon and United Pictures Corporation. The film co-stars Nancy Kwan, Nehemiah Persoff, Robert Alda, Patricia Smith, David Brian, and noted jazz musician Buddy Greco as nightclub entertainer Albert Lucky Jones. The melodramatic promotional tagline of The Girl Who Knew Too Much was: You have to be crazy or in love — to take on the syndicate! The film was intended to be a vehicle for Adam West to escape his Batman stereotype by playing a cynical, hard- edged tough guy. The movie's dialogue is typified by a scene between West's Cain and the boozy Mrs. Grinaldi played by Smith: The Girl Who Knew Too Much was not a box office success in theatrical release, but became a staple of late- night showings on WCBS- TV and other television stations in the early 1970s. It then disappeared from sight for decades and was in danger of becoming a lost film. However, it finally appeared in a home video release that came on May 28, 2013, on Blu-ray and DVD.

The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1934 British thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, featuring Peter Lorre, and released by Gaumont British. It was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of Hitchcock's British period. The film is Hitchcock's first film using this title and was followed later with his own 1956 film using the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book- length interview Hitchcock/ Truffaut( 1967), in response to filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional. However, it's been claimed this statement can not be taken at face value. The 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with G. K. Chesterton's 1922 book of detective stories of the same name. Hitchcock decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the stories in the book.

What is the place of birth of the director of film The Fj Holden?",australia,sydney australia,0.8530965447425842,0.5797386715376658,False
291,"The FJ Holden is a 1977 Australian film directed by Michael Thornhill.  The FJ Holden is a snapshot of the life of young teenage men in Bankstown, New South Wales, Australia in the 1970s and deals with the characters' difficulty in reconciling mateship with respect for a girlfriend. Debi Enker in Australian Cinema comments: The FJ Holden presents the suburbs as a cultural and spiritual desert. It is a place where regular bouts with the bottle are the only antidote for lives without hope or direction. The film initially received a R classification from the Australian Film Board of Review, but after an appeal to the censors it was revised to a M classification for moderate sex scenes and moderate coarse language. However, all states except Victoria and New South Wales exercised their right to override the Commonwealth decision and retained the R classification.

Holden Caulfield, a teenager from New York City, is living in an unspecified institution in southern California near Hollywood in 1951.

As he waits, Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas.

The Holden FJ series is a range of motor vehicles which was produced in Australia by Holden from 1953 to 1956. The FJ was the second model of an all Australian car manufactured by Holden and was based upon the established 48- 215 series, commonly referred to as the FX. The sedan, in Standard, Business and Special trim levels, and a coupe utility were announced in October 1953 and were followed by a Panel van derivative in December of that year. A wagon prototype was built but the bodystyle was not put into production. In 1954, Holden's first exports began with sales of the FJ in New Zealand. The FJ, of monocoque construction, broadly followed the silhouette of its predecessor, but featured a bolder horizontal styled front grille, along with comfort and decoration upgrades in a new sedan model named the' Holden Special'. Originally specified as achieved at 3,800 rpm, the claimed maximum power output from the six- cylinder engine was increased to achieved at 4,000 rpm. In 1955 the car underwent a mild interior facelift for the Holden Special sedan, along with a variation in paint and trim options. The FJ series was progressively replaced by models from the Holden FE series from July 1956 to May 1957 with a total of 169,969 examples produced. There are nearly 20 specific FX- FJ Holden Car Clubs of Australia with members committed to preserving them. These clubs organise a national gathering for FX- FJ Holden enthusiasts every second year.

Which country Anthemiolus's father is from?",germany,roman empire,0.23592700064182281,0.0,False
301,"Anthemiolus (died c. 471 AD) was the son of the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius (467–472) and Marcia Euphemia, daughter of the Eastern Roman emperor Marcian. His name means little Anthemius and is a diminutive of his and his father's name Anthemius, in order to distinguish them both. His life is known only from the Chronica Gallica of 511. He was sent by his father to Gaul with a powerful army, accompanied by three generals — Thorisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus — in order to oppose the Visigoths then occupying Provence and threatening to conquer the Auvergne. He and his generals were defeated by the Visigothic king Euric near Arles and all four of them lost their lives. The Chronica, in entry 649, states: Antimolus a patre Anthemio imperatore cum Thorisario, Everdingo et Hermiano com. stabuli Arelate directus est, quibus rex Euricus trans Rhodanum occurrit occisisque ducibus omnia vastavit Antimolus was sent by his father, Emperor Anthemius, to Arles, with Thorisarius, Everdingus and Hermanius, comes [or comitesstabuli: King Euric met them on the far side of the Rhone and, having killed the duces, laid everything waste. According to the Chronica, this event falls between the succession of Euric (467) and the war between Anthemius and Ricimer (471–472). It can probably be further narrowed to the period when Anthemius is known to have been organising a concerted effort to remove the Visigoths from Gaul between 468 and 471, a period during which an army led by the Briton Riothamus was defeated near Déols. It is not impossible that Anthemiolus' army was sent to reinforce Riothamus and that Euric defeated both forces in turn, probably in either 470 or 471.

Waylon Arnold Jennings (June 15, 1937 – February 13, 2002) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician. Jennings began playing guitar at age eight and began performing at age twelve on KVOW radio, after which he formed his first band, The Texas Longhorns. Jennings left high school at age sixteen, determined to become a musician, and bounced around as a performer and DJ on KVOW, KDAV, KYTI, KLLL, in Coolidge, Arizona, and Phoenix. In 1958, Buddy Holly arranged Jennings's first recording session, and hired him to play bass. Jennings gave up his seat on the ill-fated flight in 1959 that crashed and killed Holly, J. P.  The Big Bopper Richardson and Ritchie Valens. Jennings formed a rockabilly club band, The Waylors, which became the house band at JD's, a club in Scottsdale, Arizona. He recorded for independent label Trend Records and A&M Records, but did not achieve success until moving to RCA Victor, taking on Neil Reshen as a manager, who negotiated significantly better touring and recording contracts for him. After finally wresting creative control from RCA Victor, his career turning point became the critically acclaimed albums Lonesome, On'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes, followed by hit LPs Dreaming My Dreams and Are You Ready for the Country. During the 1970s, Jennings was instrumental in the inception of outlaw country and with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter recorded country music's first platinum album, Wanted! The Outlaws. It was followed by Ol' Waylon and the hit song Luckenbach, Texas. Jennings was featured in the 1978 album White Mansions, performed by various artists documenting the lives of people in the Confederacy during the Civil War. Jennings also appeared in films and television series, including Sesame Street, and a stint as the balladeer for The Dukes of Hazzard, composing and singing the show's theme song and providing narration for the show. By the early 1980s, Jennings struggled with a cocaine addiction, which he overcame in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album Will the Wolf Survive. He toured less after 1997 to spend more time with his family.

Jennings is active mainly in outlaw country and Southern rock genres. Jennings is the son of country music legends Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter.

But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. “I love my mom,” says Jennings, “ but I like Dad ’s version better. And I believe it’s true. He didn’t make [stuff] like that up.” Currently signed to Universal South, Jennings made his debut with the single 4th Of July of his 2005 album Put the O Back in Country, which peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard country charts. Jennings has since followed with six more full-length studio albums: Electric Rodeo (2006), The Wolf (2007), Black Ribbons (2009), Family Man (2012), The Other Life (2013) and Countach (For Giorgio) (2016), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous EPs.

She was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great, king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith. Æthelflæd was born around 870 at the height of the Viking invasions of England. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule – East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered, and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings – but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people not living in areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying Æthelflæd to Æthelred. Æthelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with Æthelflæd's brother, the future King Edward the Elder. Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified Worcester, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built a new minster in Gloucester. Æthelred's health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that Æthelflæd was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern Danelaw. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint, Oswald, which were translated to the new Gloucester minster. Æthelred died in 911 and Æthelflæd then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as one of the most unique events in early medieval history. Alfred had built a network of fortified burhs and in the 910s Edward and Æthelflæd embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were Wednesbury, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as her greatest triumph. In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. Æthelflæd was succeeded by her daughter Ælfwynn, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried Ælfwynn off to Wessex. Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under Æthelred and Æthelflæd but they agree that Æthelflæd was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury, who described her as a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul. According to Pauline Stafford, like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages. In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.

Eadwig, who was now the last surviving son by his father's first marriage, was banished in 1016 and then outlawed in 1017 by Cnut, however he was reconciled with Cnut the same year and allowed to live in England, but was murdered soon after at the instigation of Cnut, possibly after attempting to rally resistance in the south west. The Anglo-Saxon claim to the throne then passed to the elder son of Æthelred's second marriage, the future Edward the Confessor. Eadwig was buried at Tavistock Abbey a place built by his uncle Ordwulf.

Raymundo Gleyzer( September 25, 1941, Buenos Aires- missing since May 27, 1976) was an Argentine political filmmaker. He specialized in documentaries. He was disappeared as an opponent of the military dictatorship, and most likely murdered. Born into a Jewish family, Gleyzer became interested in politics and film early on. All his films he put into the service of the fight against social injustice and for the revolution. He made his first film in the backward northeast of Brazil, where he barely escaped imminent death. In the early 1970s he made a film in Mexico about the so- called institutionalized revolution of the PRI ruling party. The film was banned in Argentina at first, but found a lively echo in Mexico among the students. In 1973 he co-founded the Cine de la Base group, which organized demonstrations and discussions with workers( i.e. outside the cinema industry). His last major film, Los traidores( The Traitors), presents his critique of the Peronist political movement, which played an important role in Argentina in 1973. The film depicts how union leaders have allied themselves with entrepreneurs, the military and the US to maintain their personal power and enrich themselves. On May 27, 1976, Gleyzer was abducted and tortured, by a death squad of the military government that had come to power two months earlier, and never seen again. He is thus one of the tens of thousands of desaparecidos( disappeared) of the Argentine military dictatorship, most of which were secretly murdered. Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff created a cartoon dedicated to Gleyzer and the violently disappeared people of Latin America.

Abbas Kiarostami (22 June 1940 – 4 July 2016) was an Iranian film director, screenwriter, poet, photographer, and film producer. An active film-maker from 1970, Kiarostami had been involved in the production of over forty films, including shorts and documentaries. Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the Koker trilogy (1987–1994), Close-Up (1990) , The Wind Will Carry Us (1999), and Taste of Cherry (1997), which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year. In later works, Certified Copy (2010) and Like Someone in Love (2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran: in Italy and Japan, respectively. His films Where Is the Friend’s Home?Close-Up, and The Wind Will Carry Us were ranked among the 100 best foreign films in a 2018 critics' poll by BBC Culture. Close-Up was also ranked one of the 50 greatest movies of all time in the famous decennial Sight & Sound poll conducted in 2012. Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter, film editor, art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material. He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and graphic designer. He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave, a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as Bahram Beyzai, Nasser Taghvai, Ali Hatami, Masoud Kimiai, Dariush Mehrjui, Sohrab Shahid-Saless and Parviz Kimiavi. These filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues. Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary-style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works.

During his short career, he completed numerous short films, in addition to a pair of highly regarded features, of which the first, The Mother and the Whore, is considered a key work of post-Nouvelle Vague French cinema. In his obituary for Eustache, the critic Serge Daney wrote:In the thread of the desolate 70s, his films succeeded one another, always unforeseen, without a system, without a gap: film-rivers, short films, TV programs, hyperreal fiction. Each film went to the end of its material, from real to fictional sorrow. It was impossible for him to go against it, to calculate, to take cultural success into account, impossible for this theoretician of seduction to seduce an audience. Jim Jarmusch dedicated his 2005 film Broken Flowers to Eustache.

Anastasia, the False Czar's Daughter (German: Anastasia, die falsche Zarentochter) is a 1928 German silent drama film directed by Arthur Bergen and starring Lee Parry, Hans Stüwe and Elizza La Porta. The film's art direction was by Otto Moldenhauer.

Anastasia is a 1956 American historical drama film directed by Anatole Litvak and written by Arthur Laurents. Set in interwar France, the film follows the story of a suicidal amnesiac( Ingrid Bergman), whose remarkable resemblance to the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia — the youngest daughter of the late Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, who is rumored to have survived the execution of her family — draws her into a plot devised by the former Russian White General Bounine( Yul Brynner) and his associates to swindle from the Grand Duchess an inheritance of £ 10 million. However, the ultimate hurdle to their plan is the exiled Russian aristocracy — in particular the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna( Helen Hayes) — whom their handpicked claimant must convince of her legitimacy if they wish for their scheme to succeed. The origins of Anastasia lie in a play written by Marcelle Maurette, which was in turn inspired by Anna Anderson, the most famous of the many Anastasia impostors who appeared after the death of the Imperial family in July 1918.

Aldo Weber Vieira da Rosa( November 15, 1917 – June 8, 2015) was a Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. His research interests were in ionospheric processes, energy processes and renewable energy. He is the author of Fundamentals of Renewable Energy Processes and Fundamentals of Electronics. He is also the holder of a US patent on the process for the production of ammonia. Da Rosa was born in Florianópolis, Brazil. After graduating from the Brazilian Military Academy and the both in Rio de Janeiro, he entered the Brazilian Air Force. In the early 1940s he was stationed in the US as part of a cooperative military program, and during this time he was relocated from Washington, D.C., to the Alameda Naval Air Station in the San Francisco Bay Area. This gave him the opportunity to attend Stanford for the first time and to study electrical engineering. Although he did not have an undergraduate degree, his technical experience enabled him to be admitted into the graduate program. He completed an Electrical Engineer ’s( EE) degree and around the same time, in 1944, he married fellow Stanford student Aili Ranta( M.S., 1943) and moved to Harvard University. In 1945 Aldo moved back to Brazil with his new wife. For the next twenty years Aldo was extraordinarily active in what we now refer to as aerospace activities in Brazil, while still attached to the Brazilian Air Force. From 1945 to 1951 he founded and was the first head of the Research and Standardization division of the Diretoria de Rotas Aéreas( the Brazilian FAA). Then, from 1952 to 1953 he was Associate Professor of Electronics at ITA, an engineering college in São José dos Campos. In 1954 he founded and was the first director of the Instituto de Pesquinas e Desenvolvimento( IPD) and in 1956 he became chairman of the Brazilian National Research Council. He resigned from this council following a serious injury to his leg during an international glider competition in France. From 1961 to 1963 he founded and was first chairman of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias, the Brazilian equivalent of NASA. Following all these activities, he returned to Stanford in 1963, with his family, to obtain a Ph.D. In the early 1960s, da Rosa was a helicopter test pilot for the Beija Flor, a helicopter designed by Heinrich Focke. Da Rosa retired from the Brazilian Air Force as Brigadier General in 1965 and completed his Stanford Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1966 under Professor( and later astronaut) Owen K. Garriott. His research involved the first full- physics model of the electron distribution in the ionosphere including thermal processes to describe the electron and ion temperatures. This model predicted the total electron content( TEC) of the ionosphere that was first measured at Stanford University using radio signals from the Soviet Union ’s Sputnik, a particularly important topic at the time given the developing competition in space between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Appointed a Research Associate in 1966, and then a Senior Research Associate( 1969 – 1980), Aldo became a Professor( Research) in Electrical Engineering in 1980. During this time, his interests gradually turned more to the fundamentals of energy processes and renewable energy. His classes on renewable energy were greatly appreciated by the students and he continued teaching these energy classes until 2011, well after his retirement and conversion to Professor( Emeritus) in 1983. An active Masters Swimmer, da Rosa broke 99 National Records and 37 World Records. He currently still holds the world records in the 85- 89 age group in the 200 meter IM and 200 meter breast stroke. He was inducted into the International Masters Swimming Hall of Fame in 2004. In March 2010, da Rosa was awarded the Grã- Cruz da Ordem Nacional do Mérito Científico, an honor bestowed by the President of Brazil upon Brazilian and foreign personalities recognized for their scientific and technical contributions to the cause and development of science in Brazil. Da Rosa attracted large numbers of students to his renewable energy classes at Stanford. He lectured on renewable energy topics, with an emphasis on classical physics. da Rosa died in Palo Alto, California at the age of 97 on June 8, 2015.

346,"Richard Sassanach Burke, 2nd Earl of Clanricarde, died 1582. He was the son of Ulick na gCeann Burke, 1st Earl of Clanricarde and Grace O'Carroll. He married: 1) Margaret O'Brien, daughter of Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond and Eleanor FitzGerald, before 6 October 1548; 2) Margaret O'Brien, daughter of Donough O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Thomond and Helen Butler, on 24 November 1553; and 3) Julia MacCarthy, daughter of Cormac 'Oge' MacCarthy, in 1568. He and his first wife, Margaret O'Brien (daughter of Murrough) were divorced after he claimed that she worked witchcraft against him. As a result of his father's multiple marriages and relationships there were a number of candidates contending for title Earl of Clanricarde. Richard, the oldest legitimate son, was the eventual successor. He was sporadically opposed by his brothers and half-brothers, including John, who claimed the title in 1568. Richard extended his influence at the expense of the O'Kelly's and the O'Madden's in the east of County Galway, overlordship over the O'Shaughnessey in the south, while allying himself with the O'Conor Don and the O'Brien of Thomond. Other minor allies included the MacCostelloe and MacMorris, who acknowledged him to avoid encroachment from the Bourkes of Mayo. In 1559 Clanricarde fought on the losing side at the Battle of Spancel Hill in County Clare as part of the Gaelic O'Brien succession dispute. From around 1570 his sons rebelled against him and the Anglo-Irish government. That decade witnessed regular warfare across the county which devastated towns such as Galway, Athenry and Loughrea. At the time of his death Burke had endured imprisonment in Dublin, and repeated treachery by his sons. After his death, further warfare was avoided when Ulick Burke killed his brother, John of the Shamrocks, and was acknowledged as the 3rd Earl of Clanricarde. He was called Sassanach (Saxon, or Englishman), because of his association with the Anglo-Irish. He died on 24 July 1582.

When restored, the Clanricarde estates were heavily in debt and a great deal of litigation was ongoing between the interested parties. Richard married Elizabeth Butler, one of the many daughters of Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond. It was the second marriage for Elizabeth, who was the widow of Sir Edmond Blanchville of County Kilkenny. They had two daughters, Margaret and Mary, but no son. He was succeeded by his brother, William.

William Burke, 7th Earl of Clanricarde (died 1687), Irish peer, was the son of Sir William Burke, younger son of Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde, and Joan O'Shaughnessy.

He became Lord Lieutenant of County Galway in 1680 and its Chief Governor in 1687. His first wife was Lettice Shirley, daughter of Sir Henry Shirley and Lady Dorothy Devereux and granddaughter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.

Blurt is a music print magazine and online outlet originally based in Silver Spring, MD. The magazine was originally known as Harp Magazine for over 10 years, also based in Silver Spring, and was considered one of the best music magazines of the decade in the early 2000s. After Harp folded in March 2008 (at the behest of its parent company, which also owned JazzTimes, it declared bankruptcy), Blurt was founded by Harp owner Scott Crawford. Some of the main writers and editors for Harp also started Blurt with Crawford, including managing editor Fred Mills (of Asheville, NC, and also a contributing editor to StereophileMagnet and other music industry publications and alternative weeklies), senior editor Randy Harward (also an editor for the Salt Lake City weekly paper), and senior editor Andy Tennille (a journalist and photographer, currently the photographer for Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers). Blurts tag line is Real Music, Real Artists, Real OpinionsBlurt is a highly respected outlet within the music industry and has often been cited by critics and fans as the Mojo magazine of the United States. It initially launched as an all-digital, downloadable online magazine, publishing five issues in that format before moving to print for the next nine issues while also posting each issue online, frequently with expanded content, at BlurtOnline.com. In early 2010, Crawford sold the Blurt assets to Stephen Judge of Second Motion Entertainment and the company moved to the label's home of Carrboro, NC. Second Motion Entertainment also owns the record label Second Motion Records which works with such artists as Australia's The Church, Bettie Serveert, Swervedriver, Parson Red Heads and Tommy Keene. Blurt magazine announced in February 2012 that it would be relocating its offices (along with Second Motion) to Raleigh, NC, where Judge had purchased long-tenured independent record store Schoolkids Records. Editor Mills also relocated to Raleigh, assisting Judge in both running the store and publishing the magazine. As of April 2017, Schoolkids also operates locations in Durham, NC, and Carrboro, NC, and the Second Motion Records name has been changed to Schoolkids Records. The magazine, label and stores are increasingly integrated, operationally. Blurt is updated daily with new music interviews, essays and features; music news, record release announcements (vinyl is a specialty), and tour dates; exclusive videos, audio streams and bootleg MP3s; record, DVD, book and concert reviews; and blog entries by Judge, Mills, John B. Moore, Michael Toland, and Bill Kopp. Tim Hinely, founder of Dagger, a punk and indie zine first published in 1987 and still in print, and recognized by Pitchfork as one of the best, is also a contributor. As a print magazine it was distributed throughout the United States and internationally. The final print issue was #14, published at the end of 2013 and featuring Artist of the Year Jason Isbell on the cover, along with features on The Beatles, Big Star, The Replacements, Megafaun, Tommy Keene and King Khan. At that point the magazine decided to revert to publishing online in the face of declining advertising revenue. While operating as a print publication, covers were devoted to artists such as: Sonic Youth, The Avett Brothers, PJ Harvey, Of Montreal, Janelle Monáe, Spiritualized Grizzly Bear and Wilco. From 2010 to 2016 the magazine also hosted an annual day party each March in Austin at the SXSW Music Festival at the Ginger Man Pub, and photo galleries and descriptions of those parties can be viewed at the Blurtonline.com website.

John II of Baden was the third son of Margrave Jacob I of Baden-Baden and his wife Catherine de Lorraine.

At the urging of his father, most of his siblings also followed a religious career, the exceptions being his two oldest brothers Charles I and Bernard II and his sister Margaret. He studied in Erfurt, Pavia and Cologne from 1452 to 1456, together with his younger brothers George and Mark. On 21 June 1456, at the age of 22, he was elected Archbishop of Trier as John II of Baden. His mother was from Lorraine and had connections with Trier. Pope Calixtus III confirmed him as administrator of Trier, because he had not yet reached the minimum age of 35 for consecration as bishop. When he reached that age in 1465, he was consecrated by his suffragan bishop Hubertis Agrippina and the bishops of Metz and Worms. In 1459, Diether von Isenburg was elected Archbishop of Mainz, ahead of Adolph II of Nassau by a narrow margin. However, the Pope did not confirm Dieter's election. This led to the Baden-Palatinate War, in which John II and his brothers participated on the side of Adolph II of Nassau. John II of Baden supported reform in the Benedictine monasteries and encouraged them to join the Bursfelde Congregation.

On 16 January 1500, he appointed his great-nephew Jakob as co-adjutor with the right to succeed  and from 1501, Jakob led the government of the Electorate. John II died in 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein (now part of Koblenz), after a tenure of 46 years, 7 months and 18 days, the longest of any bishop of Trier. He was buried in the Cathedral of Trier in a magnificent grave that he had built during his lifetime.

She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty. Her name means She who is beloved of Aten; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped. She held several titles, performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare, who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten. Meritaten also may have served as pharaoh in her own right under the name, Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten.

With Khufu, she was the mother of the Crown Prince Kawab, and possibly Djedefre. Both Queen Hetepheres II and Pharaoh Khafra have been suggested as children of Meretites I and Khufu as well, and it is possible that Meritites II was a daughter of Meritites I as well. Auguste Mariette recorded a stela at Giza in which Meritites is said to be a favorite of both Sneferu and Khufu: King’s wife, his beloved, devoted to Horus, Mertitytes.

Eleanor of England (18 June 1269 – 29 August 1298) was an English princess, the eldest surviving daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen Eleanor of Castile. What evidence exists for Eleanor's early years suggests that while her parents were absent on Crusade between 1270 and 1274, she became very close to her paternal grandmother, Eleanor of Provence, with whom she continued to spend a good deal of time. She was also close to her sickly brother Henry. On one Pentecost Eve, Henry and Eleanor were given two partridges for their dinner, for a special treat. For a long period Eleanor was betrothed to King Alfonso III of Aragon. Alfonso's parents were under papal interdict, however, because of their claims to the throne of Sicily, which were contrary to the papal donation of the Sicilian throne to Charles I of Naples, and despite the Aragonese ruler's repeated pleas that Edward I send his daughter to them for marriage, Edward refused to send her as long as the interdict remained in place. In 1282 he declined one such request by saying that his wife and mother felt the girl, who had just turned 13, was too young to be married, and that they wanted to wait another two years before sending her to Aragon. Alfonso died before the marriage could take place. Eleanor subsequently married the French nobleman, Henry III, Count of Bar on September 20, 1293, and had two children: According to Kenneth Panton, Eleanor is credited with a daughter called Eleanor (b.1285), who supposedly married a Welshman named Llywelyn ap Owain.

377,"I Miss You is a song by American recording artist, Miley Cyrus. It was co-written by Cyrus (credited under her birth name Destiny Hope Cyrus), Brian Green, Wendy Foy Green, and produced by Brian Green. I Miss You is an homage to Cyrus' late grandfather, Ron Cyrus, who died on February 28, 2006. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, and, seeing her grandfather nearing death, Cyrus wanted to write him a song prior to his death. It was released to Radio Disney mid-year 2007 as promotion for the dual disc . The song is a ballad with rock and country influences. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics; some commented on how it deviated from her usual material at the time and how effective the message was. I Miss You appeared on two United States charts: it peaked at number nine on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, an extension of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and at number ninety-two on the defunct Pop 100. Cyrus performed the song on acoustic guitar as an encore at several stops on her first headlining concert tour, the Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007–08).

 I Miss You is a song by American recording artist Beyoncé, taken from her fourth studio album, 4( 2011). It was written by Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyoncé and Taylor. The song's development was motivated the fact that Beyoncé wanted to focus on songs being classics, songs that would last, and songs that she could sing when she becomes old. A mid-paced R&B ballad, I Miss You is influenced by the ballads of the 1980s. Its instrumentation consists essentially of synthesizers and keyboards.  I Miss You finds Beyoncé, as the protagonist, thinking deeply over her relationship with her love interest from whom she parted; however, she still pines for him and feels self- conscious for doing so.  I Miss You was generally praised by music critics who complimented its very sparse production as well as its aurally remarkable 1980s influence. Some of them also described the song as a haunting ballad and called it the highlight of the record. Critics also complimented how Beyoncé's vocals keep on alternating from desperate and calm throughout the song, and highlighted the vulnerability in her voice. Following the release of 4 in early July 2011, I Miss You charted at number 184 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 34 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart, based on downloads alone. The song was part of Beyoncé's set list for her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, held in Roseland Ballroom, New York City in August 2011.

 Missing You is a R&B song written and produced by Babyface, who produced the song for singer Mary J. Blige, who released it as the third United Kingdom single from her Share My World album, released in October 2, 1997. The song featured Shanice in background vocals and much like Seven Days, it talked about a woman in dilemma over a relationship with a man that she at first claimed she was n't in love with but then finds herself thinking about him all the time and her missing him. The song became a performance show- stopper for Blige on several stops of her Share My World tour and was indeed a highlight when she performed it on the Soul Train Music Awards, where she was greeted with a huge standing ovation afterwards. The song was released in the United Kingdom and eventually reached number nineteen there. The b-side to CD: 1 of the Missing You single was I Can Love You, which was not released as a stand- alone single in the United Kingdom.

Nikolai Alekseevich Polevoy ( Russian   )  was a controversial Russian editor, writer, translator, and historian; his brother was the critic and journalist Ksenofont Polevoy and his sister the writer and publisher of folktales Ekaterina Avdeeva. Polevoy was from an old merchant family from Kursk but was born in Irkutsk, where his father was director of a Russian-American company, and lived there until 1811, when the family moved first to Moscow and then to Kursk. His father, disappointed in his refusal to take up the family business and disapproving of his interest in literature and history, refused to pay for his education, so he taught himself. In February 1820 he moved to Moscow, where he attended both the theater and lectures at Moscow University; he visited Saint Petersburg and met Alexander Griboyedov, Vasily Zhukovsky, Faddei Bulgarin, and other literary figures, and began a literary career, publishing articles, poems, and translations in the journals of the day. In 1825 he started his own journal, Moskovskii telegrafThe Moscow Telegraph), hoping to attract the writers he admired, like Pushkin, as well as emphasize the positive contributions of the merchant class to Russia. Unfortunately, the aristocrats of the Pushkin circle viewed him as a vulgar parvenu, and his attack on Karamzin's reactionary History of the Russian State offended many influential people, notably Pyotr Vyazemsky, who had been Karamzin's ward and whose sister was married to the older historian. When Polevoy wrote his own six-volume History of the Russian People (1829–1833), it was savaged by almost everyone. The brilliant and idiosyncratic critic Apollon Grigoryev wrote in his memoirs, From our present [1864] point of view it would be impossible to conceive anything more indecent than the article that the editor of the Moscow Herald [i.e., Mikhail Pogodin] hurled against The History of the Russian People, if the articles [by Nikolai Nadezhdin] against it in the old men's European Herald had not been even more indecent... The factions do not seem to have been in their right minds thirty years ago. What was the cause of their being so hostile that they foamed at the mouth? Polevoy emphasized that history followed laws and did not depend on the actions of particular individuals; he also was one of the first to present Russian history as a confrontation between Europe and Asia. Lauren G. Leighton says, summing up the contributions of Nikolai and his brother and collaborator Ksenofont:No one should argue that the Polevoys were comparable in literary taste and talent to the aristocrats of the Pushkin pleiad; their self-educated, self-made characters are apparent in their journal. But neither should they be denied their great contribution in making leading European thinkers available to the Russian public in Russian, their eminently human liberalism, or their courage in constantly testing—and outwitting—the government censor. In 1834, after competition from both the aristocrats and the plebeians had laid waste to the Polevoys' finances, The Moscow Telegraph was closed down by the government. The Polevoys spent most of the rest of their lives editing the journals of Bulgarin and Grech. The journal was closed down because of a bad review it gave a play by Nestor Kukolnik; Bernard Pares tells the story:It must be understood that the vast distances and the thinness of population in Russia practically confined journalistic enterprise to St. Petersburg and Moscow. Even the Moscow journalists were hampered, in comparison with those of St. Petersburg, because it took them longer to guess in which direction the wind of the moment was blowing. Thus in 1834 Polevóy, who had severely reviewed a patriotic play, found, on his arrival in St. Petersburg, that it had pleased the upper society. What are you doing? said his protector, the Administrator of Police; you see how they take the play here; you will have to agree with this opinion, or else you will get yourself into terrible trouble. D. S. Mirsky writes, But his memory after his death was deservedly reverenced by the new intelligentsia as that of a pioneer and, in a sense, a martyr.

386,"Herman Friedrich Graebe or Gräbe,( June 19, 1900 – April 17, 1986) was a German manager and engineer in charge of a German building firm in Ukraine, who witnessed mass executions of the Jews of Dubno on October 5, 1942 by Nazis. Following the war he wrote a famous and horrifying testimony. Graebe gave the following eyewitness account: My foreman and I went directly to the pits. Nobody bothered us. Now I heard rifle shots in quick succession from behind one of the earth mounds. The people who had got off the trucks- men, women and children of all ages- had to undress upon the order of an SS man who carried a riding or dog whip. They had to put down their clothes in fixed places, sorted according to shoes, top clothing and undergarments. I saw heaps of shoes of about 800 to 1000 pairs, great piles of under -linen and clothing. Without screaming or weeping these people undressed, stood around in family groups, kissed each other, said farewells, and waited for a sign from another SS man, who stood near the pit, also with a whip in his hand. During the fifteen minutes I stood near, I heard no complaint or plea for mercy. I watched a family of about eight persons, a man and a woman both of about fifty, with their children of about twenty to twenty- four, and two grown- up daughters about twenty- eight or twenty- nine. An old woman with snow white hair was holding a one- year- old child in her arms and singing to it and tickling it. The child was cooing with delight. The parents were looking on with tears in their eyes. The father was holding the hand of a boy about ten years old and speaking to him softly; the boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed to the sky, stroked his head and seemed to explain something to him. At that moment the SS man at the pit started shouting something to his comrade. The latter counted off about twenty persons and instructed them to go behind the earth mound. Among them was the family I have just mentioned. I well remember a girl, slim with black hair, who, as she passed me, pointed to herself and said, twenty- three years old. I walked around the mound and found myself confronted by a tremendous grave. People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that only their heads were visible. Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads. Some of the people shot were still moving. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was nearly two- thirds full. I estimated that it already contained about a thousand people. I looked for the man who did the shooting. He was an SS man, who sat at the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet dangling into the pit. He had a tommy- gun on his knees and was smoking a cigarette. The people, completely naked, went down some steps which were cut in the clay wall of the pit and clambered over the heads of the people lying there to the place to which the SS man directed them. They lay down in front of the dead or wounded people; some caressed those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice. Then I heard a series of shots. I looked into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching or the heads lying already motionless on top of the bodies that lay beneath them. Blood was running from their necks. The next batch was approaching already. They went down into the pit, lined themselves up against the previous victims and were shot. He later provided vital testimony in the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, invoking bitter persecution from many of his countrymen. To escape the hostility, Graebe moved his family to San Francisco in 1948, where he lived until his death in 1986. Hermann Graebe was honoured as a' Righteous Among the Nations' by Yad Vashem. Another witness of the mass executions of October 1942 in Dubno was the German officer Axel von dem Bussche who, traumatised by what he had seen, in 1943 joined the German resistance around Claus von Stauffenberg and unsuccessfully tried to kill Adolf Hitler in a suicide attack in November 1943.

Philippe Le Bas (18 June 1794 in Paris – 19 May 1860 in Paris) was a French hellenist, archaeologist and translator. He was the son of Philippe Le Bas and Elisabeth Duplay, the daughter of Robespierre's landlord Maurice Duplay.

In September 1940 the first Alsatian resistance movement led by Marcel Weinum called La main noire (The black hand) was created. It was composed by a group of 25 young men aged from 14 to 18 years old who led several attacks against the German occupation. The actions culminated with the attack of the Gauleiter Robert Wagner, the highest commander of Alsace directly under the order of Hitler. In March 1942, Marcel Weinum was prosecuted by the Gestapo and sentenced to be beheaded at the age of 18 in April 1942 in Stuttgart, Germany. His last words will be: If I have to die, I shall die but with a pure heart. From 1943 the city was bombarded by Allied aircraft. While the First World War had not notably damaged the city, Anglo-American bombing caused extensive destruction in raids of which at least one was allegedly carried out by mistake. In August 1944, several buildings in the Old Town were damaged by bombs, particularly the Palais Rohan, the Old Customs House (Ancienne Douane) and the Cathedral. On 23 November 1944, the city was officially liberated by the 2nd French Armoured Division under General Leclerc.

387,"James Adam (21 July 1732 – 20 October 1794) was a Scottish architect and furniture designer, but was often overshadowed by his older brother and business partner, Robert Adam. They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the Grand Tour, leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768–1772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771–5 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived — he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

Baise- moi is a 2000 French crime thriller film written and directed by Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi and starring Karen Lancaume and Raffaëla Anderson. It is based on the novel by Despentes, first published in 1993. The film received intense media coverage because of its graphic mix of violence and explicit sex scenes. Consequently, it is sometimes considered an example of the New French Extremity. As a French noun, un baiser means a kiss, but as a verb, baiser means to fuck, so Baise- moi means simply Fuck me.

In 2000, The Film Censorship Board of Malaysia banned the film outright because of very high- impact violence and sexual content throughout.

Rauni Mollberg (April 15, 1929 – October 11, 2007) was a Finnish film director who directed movies and TV movies. In 1963 Mollberg directed movies for YLE. He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera. Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song (1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically-charged, blood-soaked tale of a young village girl's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality (Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture (Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and independent festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles. During his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film  The Earth is a Sinful Song (1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier (1985) making it the 17th highest-grossing movie in the history of Finland.

Alain Resnais( 3 June 19221 March 2014) was a French film director and screenwriter whose career extended over more than six decades. After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s, he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog( 1956), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps. Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour( 1959), Last Year at Marienbad( 1961), and Muriel( 1963), all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past. These films were contemporary with, and associated with, the French New Wave( la nouvelle vague), though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement. He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left- wing politics. He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe- Grillet, Jorge Semprún and Jacques Sternberg. In later films, Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms, including theatre, music, and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song. His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness, memory, and the imagination, and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives. Throughout his career, he won many awards from international film festivals and academies.

The show consisted of 17 young women competing for an internship at and a college scholarship. Atoosa Rubenstein was the main judge, she was the youngest editor-in-chief ever to run Seventeen magazine. They picked 17 girls from around the United States who were not only photogenic but also had been at the top of their class, to provide a role model for young women. The girls were flown to New York, where they would take part in a contest similar in format to The Apprentice — they would be given tasks to be done by Atoosa, and in each episode one of the girls would be eliminated from the competition. The winner would get her face on the cover of Seventeen magazine, a college scholarship and would be offered an internship job on the magazine. The criteria for elimination were not only performing poorly — Atoosa was watchful of how the girls talked when no one else was in the room, via cameras set up around the house. In this manner, she could watch the girls with their guards down and see what their real motivations and dreams were. In one elimination, for example, Atoosa sat down with the girl and explained that she didn't feel that the girl was in the contest for the 'right' reasons — video clips were shown to the viewers which showed the girl talking to her other roommates and explaining that she was more interested in the face-time she would get for being part of an MTV show. Where the format differed from other shows was in the first elimination round and in how the contestants found out who was eliminated. In the first episode, all 17 girls sat around the dinner table with Atoosa and had to describe in brief who they were and what they hoped they would get out of the experience. Based on this conversation, Atoosa eliminated 7 of the girls from the contest. The way the girls would generally find out who was eliminated was by sitting around a TV as Atoosa would talk to them, telling them the results of the tasks they were given. The TV screen would then display the names of the girls who would be staying in the house, written in cursive form. The girl whose name didn't appear on 'The List' was eliminated, and met with Atoosa to hear her reasoning for why she was eliminated. In the final episode, Jennifer Steele was declared the winner, with her magazine cover unveiled in Times Square. It was also revealed that Brianne Burrowes, who voluntarily left the show in an early episode of the series, was offered a job by Atoosa and will be working with Jennifer in their respective internships at the magazine.

The tagline for the film was You ’re IN, or you ’re IN THE WAY.  Massacre Mafia Style was written, produced, self- financed and directed by Duke Mitchell, and was accumulated from all of his real- life run-ins with similar characters and mob stories. Duke Mitchell was an actor and singer( providing the singing voice of Fred Flintstone in The Flintstones cartoons) and was once part of a comedy duo with partner Sammy Petrillo who together starred in the 1952 cult film Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla with Bela Lugosi of Dracula fame. The pair whose act, Mitchell& Petrillo, was imitative of Martin& Lewis( Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), was sued by Lewis after the Lugosi film was released. Mitchell went on to become a well- known crooner and nightclub act in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and as such, was known as the “ King ” of Palm Springs and ran in some of the same circles as pal Frank Sinatra. His nightclub act revolved around his Sinatra- like crooning and rockabilly Italian- American songs. With such behind- the- scenes access, Mitchell often used several of the nightclubs that he sang in as locations for his films; such places as The Buggy Whip in Los Angeles .<br> Mitchell would use the money he made singing to fund his independent films.

Later cineastes, such as Martin Scorsese, insist that despite Wise's legendary workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan. Wise achieved critical success as a director in a striking variety of film genres: horror, noir, western, war, science fiction, musical and drama, with many repeat successes within each genre. Wise's meticulous preparation may have been largely motivated by studio budget constraints, but advanced the moviemaking art. Robert Wise received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998.

He first began making films in 1927, when he and some friends attempted to make a film about World War I.

He made his feature film debut in 1942 with Aniki-Bóbó and continued to make shorts and documentaries for the next 30 years, gaining a minimal amount of recognition without being considered a major world film director. Among the numerous factors that prevented Oliveira from making more films during this time period were the political situation in Portugal, family obligations and money. In 1971, Oliveira directed his second feature narrative film, Past and Present, a social satire that both set the standard for his film career afterwards and gained him recognition in the global film community. He continued making films of growing ambition throughout the 1970s and 1980s, gaining critical acclaim and numerous awards. Beginning in the late 1980s he was one of the most prolific working film directors and made an average of one film per year past the age of 100.

He was the son of John I of Avesnes and Adelaide of Holland. From his father he received the stadholdership (government) of Zeeland. After he left Zeeland, he took up service with Charles II of Naples, who made him constable of the Kingdom of Naples. After his marriage with Isabella (16 September 1289), he had one daughter: Matilda. She would succeed him and her mother as princess. Florent settled with his wife in Morea. He negotiated the Treaty of Glarentsa with the Byzantine Empire in 1290. The situation for the Franks in Greece was hopeless by this time, however. The fall of the Angevins in Sicily meant that they were preoccupied with recouping territory there and few Western governments would send troops to defend Morea. Florent thus made peace and maintained it until 1293, when the Greeks retook Kalamata. Florent did not despair and did not reopen the war which had been ongoing until his succession: he instead sent an embassy in protest to Andronikos II Palaiologos, and the emperor returned Kalamata. In 1296, the Greeks retook the castle of Saint George in Arcadia. Florent besieged the castle, but died before it could be taken.

Where was the place of burial of Neith (Wife Of Pepi Ii)'s husband?",unknown,saqqara,0.135048508644104,0.0,False
529,"Ankhesenpepi II or Ankhesenmeryre II was a queen consort during the sixth dynasty of Egypt. She was the wife of Kings Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, and the mother of Pepi II. She was buried in a pyramid in Saqqara.

Pepi II (also Pepy II; 2284 BC – after 2247 BC, probably either 2216 or 2184 BC) was a pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt's Old Kingdom who reigned from 2278 BC. His throne name, Neferkare (Nefer-ka-Re), means Beautiful is the Ka of Re. He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks—the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II—were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II. Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.

Neith was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, one of the principal queens of the Old Kingdom pharaoh Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled (c. 2278 BC – c. 2184 BC). Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.

550,"Isabella of England (16 June 1332 –) was the eldest daughter of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault, and the wife of Enguerrand de Coucy, Earl of Bedford, by whom she had two daughters. She was made a Lady of the Garter in 1376.

Isabella of France (1295 – 22 August 1358), sometimes described as the She-Wolf of France , was Queen of England as the wife of Edward II, and regent of England from 1327 until 1330. She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She became a femme fatale figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure. Isabella arrived in England at the age of 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward later turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser and by 1325 her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point. Travelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the wars with Scotland. In 1330, Isabella's son Edward III deposed Mortimer in turn, taking back his authority and executing Mortimer. The Queen was not punished, however, and lived for many years in considerable style—although not at Edward III's court, though she often visited to dote on her grandchildren and was marginally involved in peace talks—until her death in 1358.

Two for the Road is a 1967 British romantic comedy-drama film directed by Stanley Donen and starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney. Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period. Raphael received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, Hepburn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Henry Mancini received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score. The film's theme song, Two for the Road, was composed by Mancini, who wrote many notable theme songs for films, including Moon River for Breakfast at Tiffany's. He considered Two for the Road his favourite of all the songs he wrote. Cars featured in the film, being driven by the couple or ridden in by them, include a white Mercedes-Benz 230SL roadster, an MG TD, a Triumph Herald, an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint coupé, VW Microbus, and a Ford Country Squire; the cars are often used to re-establish the time period after a jump.

He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.

He was the second son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, sister of Frederick the Great. Though known as King Charles XIII in Sweden, he was actually the seventh Swedish king by that name, as Charles IX (reigned 1604–1611) had adopted his numeral after studying a fictitious history of Sweden.

Sultan Ali Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah( died 17 May 1996) was the fifteenth Sultan of Terengganu. He was the son of the fourteenth Sultan, Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah and the legitimate heir to the throne of Terengganu. Sultan Sulaiman died on 25 September 1942 of blood poisoning. The Japanese Military Administration, which at that time occupied Malaya, proclaimed Sultan Ali as the Sultan of Terengganu. On 18 October 1943, the Thai government under Prime Minister Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram took over the administration of Terengganu from the Japanese and continued to recognise Sultan Ali as the legitimate Sultan. When the British returned after the end of World War II, they declined to recognise Sultan Ali. Allegedly, Sultan Ali was too much in debt and had been too close to the Japanese during their occupation. According to Sultan Ali, the British Military Administration wanted him removed for his refusal to sign the Malayan Union treaty. The British Military Administration also disapproved of Sultan Ali's character, where he was said to have repudiated his official consort Tengku Putri Hajjah ‘ Ain ul- Jamal, Tengku Sri Nila Utama of Pahang( the daughter of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang) and had contracted an unsuitable second marriage to a former prostitute. On 5 November 1945 the Terengganu State Council of thirteen members announced the dismissal of Sultan Ali and the appointment of Tengku Ismail as the sixteenth Sultan of Terengganu. Tengku Ismail became known as Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah and was installed on 6 June 1949 at Istana Maziah, Kuala Terengganu. Sultan Ismail's descendants have since ruled Terengganu. Sultan Ali continued to dispute his dismissal until his death on 17 May 1996.

He was the son of Iyasu I and Empress Malakotawit. He is often referred to as Irgum Tekle Haymanot or Tekle Haymanot the Cursed Tekle Haymanot became Emperor following Iyasus' retirement to an island in Lake Tana. With the support of his mother Empress Malakotawit, some of the officials argued, after the precedent of king Kaleb, that Iyasu had abdicated, and crowned Tekle Haymanot ngusä nägäst in Gondar. This act was not embraced by the entire state, and the resulting civil strife led to Iyasu's murder at the order of his son Tekle Haymanot. In September, 1707, a rebel in Gojjam declared himself ngusä nägäst under the name Amda Seyon, and made his way to the capital city, where he had himself crowned.

Amda Seyon was later killed in battle in Maitsa. However his unpopularity for having ordered the murder of his widely revered father was profound and he never overcame it. The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or Era of the Princes( a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.

Which film was released first, Assault On Dome 4 or The Battle Of The Rails?",the battle of the rails,the battle of the rails,1.0,1.0,True
600,"The Battle of the Rails( French: La Bataille du rail) is a 1946 French war film directed by René Clément. It depicts the efforts by railway workers in the French Resistance to sabotage German military transport trains during the Second World War, particularly during the Invasion of Normandy by Allied forces. Many of the cast were genuine railway workers. While critics have often historically treated it as similar to Italian neorealism, it is closer to the traditional documentaries which the director had previously worked on. The film was shown at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Prix international du jury and Clément won the Best Director Award. The film also won the inaugural Prix Méliès.

Allegheny Uprising (released in the UK as The First Rebel) is an American 1939 film directed by William A. Seiter and starring Claire Trevor and John Wayne. Based on the 1937 novel The First Rebel by Neil H. Swanson, with a screenplay by the film's producer, P. J. Wolfson, the film is loosely based on the historical event known as the Black Boys Rebellion of 1765, after the conclusion of the French and Indian War. It was produced by RKO Pictures. Clad in buckskin and a coonskin cap (as he would be a decade later in The Fighting Kentuckian), Wayne plays real-life James Smith, an American coping with British rule in colonial America. The supporting cast includes Brian Donlevy, George Sanders and Chill Wills. Claire Trevor and John Wayne also headed the cast of John Ford's Stagecoach the same year, and in Allegheny Uprising Trevor is top-billed over Wayne, due to her greater name value at the time. The film did not fare well in its initial release. The superficially similar John Ford film Drums Along the Mohawk had been released only one week prior. In the United Kingdom, where the film kept the original title, it was initially banned by the Ministry of Information for placing the British, already at war against Nazi Germany, in a bad light.

Where was the place of burial of Pareherwenemef's mother?",thebes,qv66,0.13636425137519836,0.0,False
601,"Isetnofret was an Ancient Egyptian woman and daughter of the high priest of Ptah and king's son Khaemweset( lived around 1200 BC). She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called daughter of his body. On a relief found at Saqqara she is called his beloved daughter and king's daughter. Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the noble woman Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.

Mutnedjmet was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 21st dynasty. She was the Great Royal Wife of her brother, Psusennes I. It is generally assumed that she was the mother of Pharaoh Amenemope but, since genealogical evidence is lacking, this is primarily based on the fact that he succeeded to the throne. That she was the mother of the Crown Prince Ramesses-Ankhefenmut has been challenged an now seems unlikely. She was the daughter of High Priest of Amun Pinedjem I, who was the de facto ruler of Southern Egypt from 1070 BCE onwards, then proclaimed himself pharaoh in 1054 BCE. Her mother was Duathathor-Henuttawy, a daughter of Ramesses XI, last ruler of the 20th dynasty. Three of her brothers succeeded each other as High Priests of Amun and a sister, Maatkare became God's Wife of Amun. She was buried in the Tanis tomb of her husband, in a burial chamber parallel to his. Her burial chamber was later usurped by king Amenemope, but her name and some of her titles survived, mainly on the side of the sarcophagus which was turned to the wall. Pierre Montet believes that a depiction of Mutnedjmet on the wall of the burial chamber may have been usurped and reworked into a goddess when turning the scene into a depiction of Amenemope turned out to be too much work. The present whereabouts of her mummy remain unknown, but around 1980 some bronze ushabtis of her have surfaced on the antiquitites market which suggests that her alternative burial (or a deposit of funerary equipment) may have been discovered. Several burial items are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Her titles were: King's Daughter of His Body; King's Sister; Great Royal Wife; Lady of the Two Lands; Second Prophet of Amun in Tanis.

Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30–35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.

It was released from LaBelle's first platinum album, Winner in You and was written and produced by Burt Bacharach and his former wife Carole Bayer Sager. The song was originally recorded by singer Dionne Warwick for inclusion on her album Friends. It is unclear why the song was not included on the final track list. The song was based on a relationship that had reached its end with both parties going their separate ways in a melancholy state with the occasional option of coming back together again one day. It was often stated the two performers were in separate cities when they recorded their individual parts which were then married during mixing. This was reflected in the music video produced to promote the song, which depicted LaBelle and McDonald performing the song simultaneously on different coasts. The singers were shown on separate sides of a split screen, each singing the song while walking through apartments which had identical layouts but different decor and furniture. The views from their respective porches, where they finished the song, made clear their separation by the continent.

Which country Æthelwald, Ealdorman Of East Anglia's wife is from?",scotland,english,0.311675488948822,0.0,False
632,"Æthelwald (died 962) was ealdorman of East Anglia. He is mentioned in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester along with other members of his family. He was probably the oldest son of Æthelstan Half-King and succeeded to some of his father's offices in 956 when Æthelstan became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. He was a benefactor of Ramsey Abbey and a supporter of the Benedictine reform movement which began in the reign of King Edgar. He was the first husband of Ælfthryth who married King Edgar after Æthelwald's death. William of Malmesbury's Gesta regum anglorum has a late account of Æthelwald's marriage and death. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter Ælfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent Æthelwald to see Ælfthryth, ordering him to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report.  When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, Æthelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this deception, and decided to repay Æthelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed Æthelwald. He asked Ælfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed Æthelwald during a hunt. Edward Augustus Freeman debunks the Æthelwald murder story as a tissue of romance in his Historic essays, but his arguments were in turn refuted by the naturalist William Henry Hudson in his 1920 book Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn. Æthelwald was seemingly dead by 962 as he ceases to witness charters at that time. He was buried at Ramsey Abbey. His younger brother Æthelwine succeeded to his offices. A memorial to Æthelwald, known as the Dead Man's Plack, was erected in Longparish, Hampshire in 1825.

Eleanor of Castile (1241 – 28 November 1290) was an English queen consort, the first wife of Edward I, whom she married as part of a political deal to affirm English sovereignty over Gascony. The marriage was known to be particularly close, and Eleanor travelled extensively with her husband. She was with him on the Ninth Crusade, when he was wounded at Acre, but the popular story of her saving his life by sucking out the poison has long been discredited. When she died, at Harby near Lincoln, her grieving husband famously ordered a stone cross to be erected at each stopping-place on the journey to London, ending at Charing Cross. Eleanor was better educated than most medieval queens and exerted a strong cultural influence on the nation. She was a keen patron of literature, and encouraged the use of tapestries, carpets and tableware in the Spanish style, as well as innovative garden designs. She was also a successful businesswoman, endowed with her own fortune as Countess of Ponthieu.

He remains best known for his protest songs on social and political subjects (MuryWalls) based on L'Estaca by Lluís Llach, ObawaWolf hunt (lit. Raid))). However, he was more a poet than a political singer, and his texts have not lost their relevance with the demise of the Soviet union and its communist bloc.

Kaczmarski was known not only for his politically motivated lyrics but also for his characteristically dynamic – even aggressive – classical guitar playing, and expressive performance style. His deep knowledge of not only his nation's history but also of classical literature gave his songs a particularly deep and multi-layered resonance (e.g. Powtórka z Odysei, recalled Homer's Odyssey, while the ballad Lalka masterfully retells Boleslaw Prus's second novel of the same name, The Doll.). He often performed before contrastingly different audiences: groups of friends in their homes, campus venues, and large concert halls in Poland, the rest of Europe and America.

He returned to Castile in March with an army and defeated the Laras at the Battle of Lobregal, where his erstwhile father-in-law, Osorio Martínez, was killed fighting alongside his enemies, and Nuño Pérez de Lara was captured. Nonetheless, he was unable to reestablish himself in his homeland. Shortly after 1160, with a mixed force of Christians and Muslims, Fernando besieged the recently founded city of Ciudad Rodrigo. Ferdinand II, with the militias of Salamanca and Zamora, came to its relief. Fernando was soon reconciled to the king of León, who appointed him governor first of Cuéllar, Dueñas, Salamanca, Toro, Valladolid, and Zamora, and later of Asturias and Benavente. He served Ferdinand II as majordomo, the highest court official in power, on two occasions: between 15 August 1162 and 6 September 1164 and between 19 October 1165 and 15 May 1166. In 1162 Ferdinand II conquered Toledo from Castile and placed it in the hands of Fernando Rodríguez as governor. Toledo remained a Leonese possession until 1166. In 1164 Fernando returned to Castile a second time with an army and killed Manrique Pérez de Lara in the Battle of Huete (June/July). In 1168 he was appointed alcalde in the city of León, and controlled the city's fortifications (tenente turris Legionisheld the towers of León) until 1182. In the early summer of 1169, the Portuguese freebooter Gerald the Fearless took the city of Badajoz after a long siege, but the garrison took refuge in the alcazaba, the siege of which continued. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region at the expense of both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve Gerald. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of León, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison. Fernando Rodríguez, then majordomo, was one of the Leonese leaders on this expedition. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Fernando captured Gerald. After the mêlée the Leonese had control of the town and the alcazaba, which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom. Ferdinand retained Cáceres, but Trujillo, Montánchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfragüe he gave to Fernando Ruiz. Fernando thus established a semi-independent lordship between the Tagus and Guadiana rivers, with his seat at Trujillo. In 1171 he was granted the infantaticum of León. Between 1172 and 1175 Fernando held Mayorga and Melgar de Arriba from the Crown, both had been fiefs of Osorio Martínez. He was for the remainder of his career a frequent attendee at both the Leonese and Castilian courts. The Annales compostellani record Fernando's death in the year 1185, sometime after August 16.

Fernando Ruiz de Castro (d. Bayonne, 1377), was a Galician nobleman of the House of Castro and prominent military figure. He was the third Count of Lemos, Trastámara and Sarria. He is often referred to by the appellation Toda la lealtad de España (All the loyalty of Spain), from an inscription on his tomb in Bayonne. He was the son of Pedro Fernández de Castro and Isabel Ponce de Leon. He was the brother of Juana de Castro, wife of King Peter I of Castile and half-brother of the controversial Inês de Castro (mistress of King Peter I of Portugal), and Álvaro Pires de Castro (leader of the Portuguese branch of the House of Castro). Fernando Ruiz de Castro became a prominent figure in the circle of King Peter of Castile, and served as lord steward and standard-bearer of the realm. During the Castilian Civil War, he was the leading partisan of Peter's camp, and continued fighting for the Petrist cause against the House of Trastámara even after the king's death in 1369. His first marriage in 1354 to Juana Alfonso, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso XI of Castile, produced two children: Divorced from his first wife, in 1367 he married Eleanor Enriquez, Lady of Melgar, widow of Alonso de Guzmán and daughter of Enrique Enriquez and his wife, Urraca Ponce de Leon. This marriage produced no offspring. From his mistress Mília Gonçalves, Lady of Assequins, he had one illegitimate son:

Elizabeth of Kuyavia(/ ; 1315/ 1320 – after 22 August 1345) was a Polish noblewoman of the House of Piast. She was the only daughter of Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo and his wife, whose name and origins are unknown; her brother, Wadysaw the White, was later a candidate for the Polish throne. By 1323, King Charles I of Hungary wanted to increase influence over Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia. He offered Stephan the hand of Elizabeth, the relative of his own Piast wife Elizabeth. By marrying Elizabeth of Kuyavia, Stephen received from Charles the lands to the west formerly held by Mladen I Šubi of Bribir and Usora and Soli in the north formerly held by Vladislav, King of Syrmia. The marriage was celebrated by 1339. Up to 1339, Stephan was married to an unknown Bulgarian princess. The only child which can be attributed to Elizabeth of Kuyavia without doubt is Elizabeth of Bosnia, born c. 1340. Some believe that Catherine of Bosnia, Countess of Cilli, was daughter of Elizabeth of Kuyavia and Stephen II, while others argue that Catherine was daughter of Stephen II's brother Vladislaus and his wife Jelena Šubi. Elizabeth may have also had a son, Vuk who may have survived infancy but he did not outlive his father so never became Ban of Bosnia. Vuk may have been the son of one of Stephen's previous two wives. Stephen outlived Elizabeth. It is unknown what Elizabeth died of. Judging by the time, it is possible that she died of Black Death, which was sweeping across Europe during the 14th century. Banness Elizabeth was buried in Bobovac in a tomb which she shared with her husband, brother- in- law Vladislaus and sister- in- law Jelena. After Elizabeth of Kuyavia's death, her daughter Elizabeth was fostered by the Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth and this soon led to Elizabeth's marriage to Louis I of Hungary.

Zakazane piosenki (Forbidden Songs) is a 1946 Polish musical film directed by Leonard Buczkowski. It was the first feature film to be created in Poland following the six years of World War II. The film, set during the German occupation of Warsaw during the war, tells the story of several inhabitants of the same tenement house. Their stories are loosely tied together by a set of songs, both pre-war ballads popular during the war and war-time popular songs mocking German occupation (Siekiera, motyka). The film's premiere took place on 8 January 1947 in the newly reopened cinema in Warsaw. The film proved to be highly popular and more than 10.8 million people watched it in the following three years - twice the usual average attendance in post-war Poland. In 1948 the film was re-edited and re-released in a new version, with more focus on Red Army's role as the liberator of Poland and the main ally of post-war Polish communist regime, as well as more grim outlook of the German occupation of Warsaw and German brutality in general. Main differences: However, as the farcical plot and all-familiar songs were mostly free of ideological subtexts, the film remained popular in the decades to come and some of its songs re-emerged in slightly modified form during the 1980s martial law and struggle against the Communist rule. The film remains well-known and popular even in modern Poland, being screened by the public Polish Television (TVP) on a regular basis. Both editions have been published on DVD in Poland, by the Propaganda label, first the 1947 one, as-is, and later the 1948 one, in a digitally restored version.

Half Mile Lagoon once covered an area of 36000 square metres, however the largest of the remaining pools was only approximately 100 square metres( when surveyed in 2005). This area is an example of decreasing water levels which have impacted on many of the smaller dune lakes on the Aupouri Pensinsula. Half Mile Lagoon lies directly adjacent to the Aupouri pine forest, and much of the catchment land use is pastoral.

Lake Waitaki is the smallest, oldest and farthest downstream of the three man-made lakes of the Waitaki hydroelectric project in New Zealand's South Island.

It is four kilometres to the northeast of the larger Lake Waikaremoana, into which it drains via the Aniwaniwa Stream. The smaller lake's surface is at an altitude of 880 metres above sea level- considerably higher than that of Waikaremoana- and as such the stream has several fine waterfalls such as the Aniwaniwa Falls and Mokau Falls. Several small islets are found in the lake. One of these, Rahui, itself contains a tiny lake- one of New Zealand's very rare lakes within lakes. Numerous flora species are found within the lake catchment basin, crown fern( Blechnum discolor) being a widespread understory plant. An assortment of birds found in the North Island are present at the national park except for the weka.

The second son of the 26th king Seong, he assumed the throne after the death of his older brother and 27th king Wideok, but reigned only briefly before his own death. The Samguk Yusa describes him as the son of Wideok, but this is considered an error. His reign saw major inroads from the neighbouring Silla and Goguryeo kingdoms, with Silla occupying the present-day Seoul area and trading directly with China. Baekje's commercial positions along the Yellow Sea coast were now dominated by Goguryeo, trading outposts in China were lost to the Sui Dynasty's unification, and Japan's political centralization outgrew Baekje's influence as well. The decline of external commerce and influence led to infighting among the nobility. He was succeeded by his son Beop.

Gaero of Baekje (?–475, 455–475) was the 21st king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the eldest son of the 20th king Biyu. He died in battle as Baekje's capital in the present-day Seoul region fell to the northern rival kingdom Goguryeo.

The General Died at Dawn is a 1936 American drama film that tells the story of a mercenary who meets a beautiful girl while trying to keep arms from getting to a vicious warlord in war-torn China. The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham Two-Gun Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China. This is reported to be the first film to use foam latex prosthetics. Makeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors.

Luis Buñuel Portolés( 22 February 1900 – 29 July 1983) was a Spanish- born Mexican filmmaker who worked in France, Mexico and Spain. When Buñuel died at age 83, his obituary in The New York Times called him an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant- garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later. His first picture, Un Chien Andalou —made in the silent era—was called the most famous short film ever made by critic Roger Ebert, and his last film, That Obscure Object of Desire —made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. Writer Octavio Paz called Buñuel's work the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality ... scandalous and subversive. Often associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Buñuel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and an array of genres, including experimental film, documentary, melodrama, satire, musical, erotica, comedy, romance, costume dramas, fantasy, crime film, adventure, and western. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Buñuel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, Buñuel nearly always made Buñuel films.

Wong Kar-wai (born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama  As Tears Go By (1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles.  Days of Being Wild (1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express (1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

David Wark Griffith( January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948) was an American film director. Widely considered as the most important filmmaker of his generation, he pioneered the feature- length movie and many enduring cinematic techniques, such as the close- up. His film The Birth of a Nation( 1915) broke box- office records but also attracted much controversy, as it depicted African Americans in a negative light and glorified the Ku Klux Klan.  Intolerance( 1916) was made as an answer to his critics. Several of Griffith's later films were also successful, including Broken Blossoms( 1919), Way Down East( 1920), and Orphans of the Storm( 1921), but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of his final feature, The Struggle( 1931). Together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, he founded United Artists, enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios. Griffith was a founder member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Taxi! is a 1932 American pre-Code gangster film directed by Roy Del Ruth and starring James Cagney and Loretta Young. The film includes two famous Cagney dialogues, one of which features Cagney conducting a conversation with a passenger in Yiddish, and the other when Cagney is speaking to his brother's killer through a locked closet, Come out and take it, you dirty yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door! The provenance of this sequence led to Cagney being famously misquoted as saying, You dirty rat, you killed my brother. To play his competitor in a ballroom dance contest, Cagney recommended his pal, fellow tough-guy-dancer George Raft, who was uncredited in the film. In a lengthy and memorable sequence, the scene culminates with Raft and his partner winning the dance contest against Cagney and Young, after which Cagney slugs Raft and knocks him down. As in The Public Enemy (1931), several scenes in Taxi! involved the use of live machine gun bullets. After a few of the bullets narrowly missed Cagney's head, he outlawed the practice in his future films. In the film they see a fictitious Warner Bros. movie at the cinema called Her Hour of Love in which Cagney cracks a joke about the film's leading man's appearance (an unbilled cameo by Warners contract player Donald Cook, who had played Cagney's brother in The Public Enemy) saying, his ears are too big. Also advertised in the cinema lobby in the film is The Mad Genius, an actual film starring John Barrymore which was released the previous year by Warners and is a plug by them.

Frank Ripploh (September 2, 1949 – June 24, 2002) was a German actor, film director, and author. He is best remembered for his semi-autobiographical 1980 film Taxi zum Klo. The film, produced on a shoestring budget of 100,000 DM, explored the day-to-day life of a Berlin schoolteacher who also led a very active gay sex life. Extremely explicit for its day, and for some time afterward (to the point where the film was not passed uncut by the British Board of Film Classification until 2011), Taxi zum Klo was considered groundbreaking for the subject matter it portrayed, and achieved something of a cult status among gay audiences of the time. In 1987, Ripploh directed a sequel entitled Taxi nach Kairo, but the film was not considered as successful as its predecessor, and it was not released outside Germany. Ripploh also participated in the creation of a small number of other art house films during the 1980s, and had a role in the 1982 movie Querelle directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Ripploh died of cancer in 2002.

Murder Ahoy! is the last of four Miss Marple films made by Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer that starred Margaret Rutherford. As in the previous three, the actress plays Agatha Christie's amateur sleuth Miss Jane Marple, with Charles' Bud' Tingwell as( Chief) Inspector Craddock and Stringer Davis( Rutherford's real- life husband) playing Mr Stringer. The film was made in 1964 and directed by George Pollock, with David Pursall and Jack Seddon credited with the script. The music was by Ron Goodwin. Location shots included Denham Village and St Mawes, Cornwall. Unlike the previous three films that were adapted from Christie novels – The 4.50 from PaddingtonMurder, She Said – the only Miss Marple novel used), After the Funeral( a Poirot mystery, adapted for Miss Marple with the title Murder at the Gallop) and Mrs. McGinty's Dead( another Poirot novel, adapted as Murder Most Foul) – this film used an original screenplay that was not based on any of Christie's stories. It does, however, employ elements of the Miss Marple story They Do It With Mirrors. Specifically, the Battledore is a training ship for teenage boys with criminal tendencies, who are supposedly being set on the straight and narrow path – when, in fact, one of the members of the crew is training them for careers in housebreaking. Likewise, in They Do It With Mirrors, Lewis Serrocold is running his wife's mansion, Stonygates, as a boarding school for delinquent youths, to straighten out their lives – but, in fact, he is training selected students to hone their criminal skills, not to give them up. That is the only element borrowed into the film from a Christie story. There is also an entirely tongue- in- cheek reference to The Mousetrap, the Christie play that has been running continuously on the West End since 1952. Audiences who see The Mousetrap are asked to keep the ending a secret, so it is amusing when Rutherford's Miss Marple says that she's reading a rattling- good detective yarn and I hope I wo n't be giving too much away if I say the answer is a mousetrap! She then notes that she'll say no more – otherwise, I'll spoil it for you!

774,"Robert de Vere( after c. 1165 – before 25 October 1221), hereditary Master Chamberlain of England, was son of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, and Agnes of Essex. He succeeded his brother as the third Earl of Oxford, and was one of the twenty- five guarantors of Magna Carta. Robert de Vere was the second surviving son of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, and his third wife, Agnes of Essex. The date of his birth is not known, but he was likely born after 1164. Almost nothing is known of his life until 1207, when he married Isabel de Bolebec, the widow of Henry de Nonant( d.1206) of Totnes, Devon. In 1206- 7 Isabel and her sister Constance were co-heiresses of their niece, another Isabel de Bolebec, the countess of Oxford by her marriage to Robert's brother, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford. They divided the barony of Whitchurch. The fact that aunt and niece had identical names, Isabel de Bolbec, and were successively countesses of Oxford and heiresses of Whitchurch has led to confusion between the two women. When Robert's brother, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford, died in the latter half of 1214, Robert succeeded to his title and estates and the hereditary office of Master Chamberlain of England. The dower of Earl Aubrey's second wife, Alice( possibly his cousin, a daughter of Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk), had not been formalized. In 1215 Oxford settled his sister- in- law's dower by lot, the earl drawing two knights' fees for every one drawn by Alice. This is the only known instance of dower being settled in this manner. Oxford joined the disaffected barons who met at Stamford and forced King John to issue Magna Carta at Runnymede on 15 June 1215. The earl was elected one of the barons who were to guarantee the King's adherence to its terms. Together with other Magna Carta barons, he was excommunicated as a rebel by Pope Innocent III on 16 December 1215, and joined them in offering the crown to Prince Louis of France. Oxford took up arms against King John, but pledged loyalty to him after the King had taken Castle Hedingham in March 1216. Later in the same year, however, he did homage to Prince Louis at Rochester. Louis entered London and was proclaimed King. On 14 June 1216, he captured Winchester and soon controlled over half of England. In the midst of this crisis, King John died, prompting many of the barons to desert Louis in favor of John's nine- year- old son, Henry III. In 1217 Prince Louis retook Castle Hedingham and restored it to Oxford, but despite this Oxford transferred his allegiance to the new King in October 1217. Although he did homage to Henry, he was not fully restored in his offices and lands until February 1218. Earl Robert served as a king's justice in 1220- 21, and died shortly before 25 October 1221. He was buried at Hatfield Regis Priory, where either his son, Hugh de Vere, 4th Earl of Oxford, or his grandson, Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford had an effigy erected in which he is depicted in chain mail, cross- legged, pulling his sword from its scabbard and holding a shield displaying his de Vere arms.

Edward Charles Richard (Graf von) Taaffe (1898–1967), known as Richard, was an Austrian gemmologist who found the first cut and polished taaffeite in November 1945. He was the son of Count Henry Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe, an Austrian landowner and Maria Magda Fuchs, his grandfather the Austrian Prime Minister Eduard Taaffe. His father had once held hereditary titles from two different countries: he was a Count (Graf) of the Holy Roman Empire and a viscount in the Peerage of Ireland. Richard Taaffe, however, inherited neither the viscountcy, which was suspended by the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 in 1919, as his father had served on the Austrian side in World War I, nor the title of Count, as Austria had generally abolished titles of nobility in 1919. Taaffe was nonetheless almost always referred to in English-speaking countries as count. Taaffe grew up on the Bohemian estate of Ellischau, the family seat. For a short time, the composer Ralph Benatzky was his tutor. In the years after the First World War, Richard Taaffe emigrated to the Irish Free State and worked there as a gemmologist. In October 1945, he discovered the very rare mineral Taaffeite (Mg 3 Al 8 BeO 16, also known as Magnesiotaaffeite, 2N'2S), which was later named after him: Taaffe had a large number of old cut gems obtained from the Dublin jeweller Robert Dobbie, extracted from old jewellery. Upon close examination, Taaffe found that a spinel-derived purple stone originating from Sri Lanka had a birefringence that was absent in a spinel. Unable to explain this phenomenon, Taaffe sent the stone to B. W. Anderson in the London Chamber of Commerce's laboratory. After extensive analysis, it was finally recognized that the stone was an unidentified mineral, which was confirmed in 1949 by the discovery of a second specimen. With Richard Taaffe's death in 1967, no heirs to either title remained and both the Austrian and the Irish titles became extinct.

The title originates with a disputed comment attributed to British Lieutenant General Frederick Browning, deputy commander of the First Allied Airborne Army, who told Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, the operation's architect, before the operation: I think we may be going a bridge too far. The comment was in reference to the intention of seizing the Arnhem bridgehead over the Rhine river—the culmination of a thrust into the occupied Netherlands which would allow the Allies to outflank German defences in order to end the war by Christmas of 1944.

Jean-Michel André Jarre (born 24 August 1948) is a French composer, performer and record producer. He is a pioneer in the electronic, ambient and new-age genres, and known for organising outdoor spectacles featuring his music, vast laser displays, large projections and fireworks. Jarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, jazz musicians and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales. His first mainstream success was the 1976 album Oxygène. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 12 million copies. Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician. As of 2004, Jarre had sold an estimated 80 million albums. He was the first Western musician officially invited to perform in the People's Republic of China and holds the world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event for his Moscow concert on 6 September 1997, which was attended by 3.5 million people.

He was also an accomplished poet. Appointed to the Lan Na throne by his father King Bayinnaung of Burma, Nawrahta dutifully contributed to his half-brother King Nanda's debilitating war effort against Siam (1584–95). He declared independence in 1597 after having defeated a 1595–96 invasion by Lan Xang on his own. From 1599 onward, he was forced to deal with a Lan Xang backed rebellion in Nan, and a Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai and Chiang Saen. He defeated the Chiang Rai rebellion in 1601–02 but was eventually forced to submit to Siam soon after. He defeated an invasion by Lan Xang in 1602–03, regaining Nan in the process.

815,"Leo IV the Khazar (Greek:    , Len IV ho Khazaros; 25 January 750 – 8 September 780) was Byzantine Emperor from 775 to 780 AD. He was born to Emperor Constantine V and Empress Tzitzak in 750. He was elevated to caesar the next year, in 751, and married to Irene of Athens in 768. When Constantine V died in September 775, while campaigning against the Bulgarians, Leo IV became senior emperor on 14 September 775. In 778 Leo raided Abbasid Syria, decisively defeating the Abbasid army outside of Germanicia. Leo died on 8 September 780, of tuberculosis. He was meant to be succeeded by his son Constantine VI, but rule instead transferred to his wife Irene, who assumed the role of regent and later empress.

Leo I , also Levon I or Leon I, (unknown – Constantinople, February 14, 1140) was the fifth lord of Armenian Cilicia or “Lord of the Mountains” (1129/1130-1137). He learned to exploit the open, yet restrained, hostilities between the Byzantine Empire and the Crusader principalities of Edessa and Antioch. Most of his successes benefited from Byzantium’s pre-occupation with the threats of Zengi (the atabeg of Mosul) from Aleppo and the lack of effective Frankish rule, especially in the Principality of Antioch. He expanded his rule over the Cilician plains and even to the Mediterranean shores. In his time, relations between the Armenians and the Franks (the Crusaders), two former allies, were not always as courteous as before: a major cause of dissension between them was the ownership of the strongholds of the southern Amanus, and on the neighboring coasts of the Gulf of Alexandretta. Leo was captured after being invited to a meeting by the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus, who had sworn a false promise of peace. Leo and two of his sons were taken captive and imprisoned in Constantinople where Leo died shortly after.

Pope Leo X (11 December 1475 – 1 December 1521), born Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici, was pope and ruler of the Papal States from 9 March 1513 to his death in 1521. Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence, Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of the Florentine Republic, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489. Following the death of Pope Julius II, Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College. Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, but struggled to implement the reforms agreed. In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino, but which reduced papal finances. In Protestant circles, Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter's Basilica, a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther's 95 Theses. He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation, and his Papal Bull of 1520, Exsurge Domine, condemned Martin Luther's condemnatory stance, rendering ongoing communication difficult. He borrowed and spent money without circumspection. A significant patron of the arts, upon election Leo is alleged to have said, Since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it.  Under his reign, progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms. Leo also reorganised the Roman University, and promoted the study of literature, poetry and antiquities. He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. He was the last pope not to have been in priestly orders at the time of his election to the papacy.

824,"Terrence Frederick Malick (born November 30, 1943) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. Malick began his career as part of the New Hollywood film-making wave with the films Badlands (1973), about a murderous couple on the run in 1950s American Midwest, and Days of Heaven (1978), which detailed the love-triangle between two labourers and a wealthy farmer at the turn of the century, before a lengthy hiatus. He returned to directing with films such as The Thin Red Line (1998), The New World (2005), and The Tree of Life (2011), being awarded the Golden Bear at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival and the Palme d'Or at the 64th Cannes Film Festival, respectively. Malick's films have been noted for exploring themes such as individual transcendence, nature, and conflicts between reason and instinct. They are typically marked by broad philosophical and spiritual overtones, as well as the use of meditative voice-overs from individual characters. The stylistic elements of the director's work have inspired divided opinions among film scholars and audiences; some praised his films for their cinematography and aesthetics, while others found them lacking in plot and character development. His first five films have nonetheless ranked highly in retrospective decade-end and all-time polls.

Countess Marie Karoline von Fuchs-Mollard (14 January 1681 – 27 April 1754), known as Charlotte, was the governess of Maria Theresa of Austria. Born in Vienna, Marie Karoline came to the imperial court as lady-in-waiting of the future queen consort of Portugal, Maria Anna of Austria, the daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1710, she married Count Christoph Ernst von Fuchs, with whom she had two daughters. Empress Elisabeth Christine entrusted the Countess with the education and upbringing of her daughter Maria Theresa, the heiress presumptive of the Habsburg dominions, when the girl was born in 1717. Countess Fuchs taught her etiquette and practically raised her. Maria Theresa developed a notably close relationship with Countess Fuchs. When Maria Theresa succeeded her father as the ruler of Hungary, Bohemia and Austria, she gave Countess Fuchs a castle (Fuchsschlössl) and made her a chatelaine. When Countess Fuchs died in Vienna, Maria Theresa ordered that she be buried in the Imperial Crypt. Thus, the Countess has the honour of being the only non-Habsburg buried in the Imperial Crypt. The 150th anniversary of her death was celebrated by a special Mass in the Capucin Crypt.

Who is Adolf, Duke Of Bavaria's maternal grandfather?",matthias corvinus,adolph i,0.4616924226284027,0.0,False
826,"Adolf (7 January 1434, Munich - 24 October 1441, Munich) was a German nobleman. He was a Duke of Bavaria-Munich in the House of Wittelsbach. He was the eldest son of William III, Duke of Bavaria and Margaret of Cleves. His younger brother William of Bavaria-Munich died in infancy. Since William III's brother Ernest and Ernest's son Albert III were available as ruling dukes, Adolf's role was very limited. He died aged only seven and thus had little effect on the duchy's fortunes.

Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria (Albrecht Luitpold Ferdinand Michael; 3 May 1905 – 8 July 1996) was the son of the last crown prince of Bavaria, Rupprecht, and his first wife, Duchess Marie Gabrielle in Bavaria. He was the only child from that marriage that reached adulthood. His paternal grandfather was Ludwig III of Bavaria, the last king of Bavaria, who was deposed in 1918.

Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, also known as Johann Nepomuk Hüttler (19 March 1807 – 17 September 1888), was a maternal great-grandfather and possibly also the paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler. Johann Nepomuk was named after the Bohemian Saint Johann von Nepomuk. Some view this name as evidence that Nepomuk and subsequently his great-grandson Adolf Hitler had Czech ancestry. However, Johann von Pomuk/Johann Nepomuk, was an important saint for Bohemians of both German and Czech ethnicity. Nepomuk thus only indicates ties to Bohemia and central Europe. Nepomuk became a relatively prosperous farmer and was married to Eva Maria Decker (1792–1873) who was fifteen years his senior. On 19 January 1830, Eva Hiedler gave birth to Johanna. Legally, he was the step-uncle of Alois Schicklgruber (later Alois Hitler), the stepson of his brother Johann Georg Hiedler, a wandering miller. For reasons unknown, Johann Nepomuk took in Alois when he was a boy and raised him. It is possible that he was, in fact, Alois' natural father but could not acknowledge this publicly due to his marriage. Another, and perhaps simpler, explanation for this kindness is that Nepomuk took pity on the ten-year-old Alois and took him in. Alois was, after all, the stepson of his brother Johann Georg, and Nepomuk may have known that in fact Alois was Johann Georg's natural child. After the death of Alois' mother Maria, it could hardly have been a suitable life for a ten-year old child to be raised by an itinerant miller. Nepomuk left Alois a considerable portion of his life savings. Nepomuk's granddaughter, Klara, had a longstanding affair with Alois before marrying him in 1885 after the death of his second wife. In 1889 she gave birth to Adolf Hitler.

Pornography: A Thriller is a 2009 American mystery/thriller film, written and directed by David Kittredge. Pornography: A Thriller is a non-linear story in three parts, all revolving around the disappearance of fictional adult gay film actor Mark Anton (Jared Grey). The first act depicts Anton's final days in 1995, the second is about writer Michael Castigan (Matthew Montgomery) as he searches for the truth in 2009 about what happened to Anton, and the third revolves around 2009 adult film actor Matt Stevens's (Pete Scherer) attempt to make The Mark Anton Story, based in part on his dreams of what happened to Anton. The film uses an unconventional structure, with actors playing multiple roles in different sections, and uses dream logic to tell its story through a subjective point of view. Because of this, it has been compared to the work of David Lynch (most notably Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive) and David Cronenberg (notably Videodrome). Kittredge says about the structure, We wanted to replicate the dream logic of a nightmare. So even though we don’t spell everything out for the audience, the film is still a complete whole and has its own fully formed arc that’s hopefully a satisfying whole.

He is the son of Georgia Hart of the Hart family and wrestler B.J. Annis. Hart achieved an early degree of fame when he became the youngest wrestler to be signed to the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE). His subsequent release and controversial actions while wrestling on the independent circuit have earned him a measure of infamy. Outside of the ring Annis has been a mentor to several young wrestlers and has been a trainer at wrestling schools. Among his trainees are Jack Evans, Pete Wilson and his younger cousin Matt Hart.

Stewart Edward Hart, (May 3, 1915 – October 16, 2003) was a Canadian professional wrestler, wrestling booker, promoter, coach and trainer, football player, amateur wrestler, and sailor. He is best known for founding and handling Stampede Wrestling, a professional wrestling promotion based in Calgary, Alberta, teaching many individuals at its associated wrestling school The Dungeon and establishing a professional wrestling dynasty consisting of his relatives and close trainees. As the patriarch of the Hart wrestling family, Hart is the ancestor of many wrestlers, most notably being the father of Bret and Owen Hart as well as the grandfather of Natalya Neidhart, Teddy Hart and David Hart Smith. Hart was born to a poor Saskatchewan family but became a successful amateur wrestler during the 1930s and early 1940s, holding many national championships, as well as engaging in many other sports. He began wrestling for show in 1943 with the Royal Canadian Navy while serving in World War II as he could not go to the 1940 Summer Olympics due to the war. After leaving the service he travelled to America and debuted professionally for the New York wrestling territory in 1946. Hart was considered very handsome and a good in-ring performer, focusing on a submission-like and technical style of wrestling, but despite this and being popular in general he was not given a major spotlight by the writers, and soon after marrying Helen Smith, whom he met in New York City, he created his own promotion in Edmonton, Alberta which would be known as Stampede Wrestling and took over the surrounding wrestling territory which covered most of western Canada and the US state of Montana. The territory would go on to become known as the Stampede territory thenceforth. In 1949, Stu and Helen moved to Great Falls, Montana. Hart's promotion featured a large variety of outside stars from the wrestling industry as well as homegrown talent for whom he booked storylines. Beginning from the 1950s Hart helped train a large number of people for his company and gained a reputation as one of the best teachers in the wrestling business. In October 1951, Stu and Helen moved to Calgary, Alberta, into what would become the famous Hart House. Hart remained an active full-time wrestler until the 1960s when he entered semi-in-ring retirement, thereafter he would focus mostly on promoting, booking and teaching, as well as raising his twelve children with Helen while still appearing in the ring sporadically until the 1980s. Throughout his career, Hart almost exclusively portrayed a heroic character, a so-called babyface role and only held one professional title, the NWA Northwest Tag Team Championship. After selling his territory to Titan Sports, Inc. in 1984, Hart would make several appearances on WWF television and Pay-Per-View with his wife, often involved in storylines surrounding his sons Bret and Owen and several of his sons-in-law who were signed to the company.

839,"St George William Lane Fox-Pitt (born 14 September 1856 in Malta, died 6 April 1932 in South Eaton Place) was a British electrical engineer and student of psychic phenomena. His parents were Lieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane-Fox (1827–1900) and Alice Margaret (1828–1910, née Stanley). On the death of his father's cousin Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers, the family took the name Fox Pitt-Rivers on May 25, 1880. In 1878, Fox-Pitt was granted a patent on a light bulb with a platinum-iridium filament. The patent also describes a system for power distribution using incandescent lamps in parallel. On 12 December 1879, Charles Francis Brush founded the Anglo-American Electric Light Company Ltd in the UK, and in the same year acquired the patent rights to produce the Lane-Fox incandescent lamp. On 24 March 1880, he founded a new company, Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation, which took over the previous one. About 1880, Fox-Pitt is said to have successfully experimented with charred plant fibres as the filament material. That was about the same time as the development of the light bulb with carbon filament by Edison in the United States. By 1883, Fox-Pitt had obtained further patents. Fox-Pitt wrote books on the philosophy of science, education, and social problems. He was temporarily Vice-President of the Moral Education League and organized the International Moral Education Congress. He was also one of the first active members of the Society for Psychical Research. In 1891, he repurchased the patent rights of the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation and built himself a small lamp factory. In 1898, he participated in a railway concession in Ecuador.

In 1870, Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to study the Bible. During the course of his ministry, Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul, hellfire, predestination, the fleshly return of Jesus Christ, the Trinity, and the burning up of the world. In 1876, Russell met Nelson H. Barbour; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds, which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy. The book taught that God's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally, each ending with a harvest, that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the harvest of the Gospel age, and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called the Gentile Times, at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God's kingdom on earth. Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal, Herald of the Morning. In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences, and in July, Russell began publishing the magazine Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence, stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in the last days, and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent.

Wong Kar- wai( born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best- of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama As Tears Go By( 1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles.  Days of Being Wild( 1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time( 1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time- consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express( 1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046( 2004) and The Grandmaster( 2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

Under the headline Alice Joyce to be seen in 'The Inner Chamber,' it read:Alice Joyce, the star of 'The Inner Chamber,' is kind-hearted and always ready to lend a helping hand. In one of the early scenes of the production, which will be shown at the Belmont-Waverley Strand theater on Monday and Tuesday, November 28 and 29, she poses as a stenographer, and from her scanty earnings buys her mother some fruit. Before the scene is made, the star stopped at a nearby fruit store and purchased some pears. While she was in the store, a little street urchin stopped before a window and looked longingly at the display. Miss Joyce emerged with her purchases and, spying the little lad, offered him a pear. A smile lit up his countenance as he thanked her. She walked gayley away.

883,"Steven Andrew Soderbergh( born January 14, 1963) is an American filmmaker, screenwriter, producer, and actor. He is an early pioneer of independent cinema. Soderbergh's directorial breakthrough—indie drama Sex, Lies, and Videotape( 1989) —lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry. At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win the Palme d' Or at the Cannes Film Festival which garnered the film worldwide commercial success, among numerous accolades. His breakthrough saw him to Hollywood where he directed crime comedy Out of Sight( 1998); biopic Erin Brockovich( 2000) and crime drama film Traffic( 2000), the latter winning him the Academy Award for Best Director. He found further popular and critical success with the Ocean's trilogy and film franchise( 2001 – 18); Contagion( 2011); Magic Mike( 2012); Side Effects( 2013); Logan Lucky( 2017); and Unsane( 2018). Despite his film career spanning a multitude of genres, his cinematic niche centers on psychological, crime, and heist thrillers. His films have grossed over US$ 2.2 billion worldwide and garnered nine Oscar nominations, winning seven. Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts often used for big budget Hollywood movies but with an avant garde arthouse approach to them. They center on the themes of shifting personal identities, vengeance, sexuality, morality, and the human condition. His feature films retain distinctive cinematography as a result of his liberal use of avant- garde cinema coupled with unconventional film and camera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines with plot twists, nonlinear storytelling, experimental sequencing, suspenseful soundscapes, and third person vantage points. Uniquely, he often serves as his own director of photography and editor under the respective pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard.

Philip Kaufman (born October 23, 1936) is an American film director and screenwriter who has directed fifteen films over a career spanning more than six decades. He has been described as a maverick and an iconoclast, notable for his versatility and independence. He is considered an auteur, whose films have always expressed his personal vision. Kaufman's works have included genres such as realism, horror, fantasy, erotica, Westerns, underworld crime, and inner city gangs. His choice of topics has been eclectic and sometimes controversial, having adapted novels with diverse themes and stories. Examples are Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), Michael Crichton's Rising Sun (1993), a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), and the erotic writings of Anaïs Nin's Henry & June. His film The Wanderers (1979) has achieved cult status. But his greatest success was Tom Wolfe's true-life The Right Stuff, which received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. According to film historian Annette Insdorf, no other living American director has so consistently and successfully made movies for adults, tackling sensuality, artistic creation, and manipulation by authorities. Other critics note that Kaufman's films are strong on mood and atmosphere, with powerful cinematography and a lyrical, poetic style to portray different historic periods. His later films have a somewhat European style, but the stories always stress individualism and integrity, and are clearly American.

It was released from LaBelle's first platinum album, Winner in You and was written and produced by Burt Bacharach and his former wife Carole Bayer Sager. The song was originally recorded by singer Dionne Warwick for inclusion on her album Friends. It is unclear why the song was not included on the final track list. The song was based on a relationship that had reached its end with both parties going their separate ways in a melancholy state with the occasional option of coming back together again one day. It was often stated the two performers were in separate cities when they recorded their individual parts which were then married during mixing. This was reflected in the music video produced to promote the song, which depicted LaBelle and McDonald performing the song simultaneously on different coasts. The singers were shown on separate sides of a split screen, each singing the song while walking through apartments which had identical layouts but different decor and furniture. The views from their respective porches, where they finished the song, made clear their separation by the continent.

897,"Cervantes is a highly fictionalized 1967 film biography of the early life of Miguel de Cervantes( 1547 – 1616). It was the first screen biography of the author. Directed by Vincent Sherman, and filmed in color, it stars Horst Buchholz as Cervantes; Gina Lollobrigida as a prostitute with whom he becomes involved; José Ferrer as Hassan Bey, the Turk who held Cervantes in captivity; Louis Jourdan as Cardinal Giulio Acquaviva; and Fernando Rey as King Philip II. Filming began in 1966, and the movie was released in several countries between 1967 and 1969.

Compañeros (Spanish: Vamos a matar, compañeros, lit. Let's Go and Kill, Companions) is a 1970 Zapata Western film directed by Sergio Corbucci. The film stars Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, Jack Palance and Fernando Rey. The soundtrack for the film was written by Ennio Morricone, and the orchestra was conducted by Bruno Nicolai. Compañeros is one of Corbucci's best-known westerns, as well as one of the best-known spaghetti westerns altogether. The film has been compared to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, as it intertwines the paths of several characters in the middle of a conflict, but takes place during the Mexican Revolution instead of the American Civil War. Due to the setting and Nero's and Milián's characters, it is similar also to Corbucci's earlier Zapata Western, The Mercenary, which was released two years earlier. Alejandro Ulloa was the cinematographer for both films. Compañeros is the only film in which the two stars of Italian genre films, Franco Nero and Tomás Milián, acted together. Nero later complained that Corbucci concentrated too much on Milian, and refused to act in Long Live Your Death if Corbucci was to direct it.

Jacob van Huysum( 1688 – 1740) was an 18th- century botanical painter from the Northern Netherlands. Van Huysum was baptized 25 February 1688 in Amsterdam. Both his father Justus van Huysum( 1659 – 1716), and his brother Jan van Huysum( 1682 – 1749), were celebrated flower painters. His manner of painting was very like that of his brother. His approach to botanical illustration, while preserving botanical accuracy, captured a more painterly aspect of his subject. This contrasts with the meticulously exact mode of Georg Dionysius Ehret, his contemporary colleague. Jacob arrived in England in about 1721, and for a while lived in the house of his patron, Mr. Lockyear of South Sea House. Later he enjoyed the patronage of Sir Robert Walpole, who befriended him, and commissioned him to paint decorative works for his house at Houghton in Norfolk. More importantly he produced most of the 50 illustrations for John Martyn's Historia Plantarum Rariorum( London: 1728- 38), and all the drawings for Catalogus Plantarum, an index of trees, shrubs, plants and flowers( London: 1730). His pupil was Louis Fabritius Dubourg.  Historia Plantarum Rariorum depicted plants from the Chelsea Physic Garden and the Cambridge Botanic Garden. These plants had come from the Cape of Good Hope, North America, the West Indies, and Mexico. Elisha Kirkall produced the mezzotint engravings. Each plate was dedicated to a patron and showed an engraved coat- of- arms or monogram. Besides van Huysum, other artists were William Houstoun, Massey, G. Sartorys, and R. Sartorius. The work was published in five parts of ten plates each between 1728 and 1737, and was sold by subscription. The venture was not a financial success and publication ceased in 1737.

907,"Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus( c. 12 February AD 41 – 11 February AD 55), usually called Britannicus, was the son of Roman emperor Claudius and his third wife Valeria Messalina. For a time he was considered his father's heir, but that changed after his mother's downfall in 48, when it was revealed she had engaged in a bigamous marriage without Claudius' knowledge. The next year, his father married Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' fourth and final marriage. Their marriage was followed by the adoption of Agrippina's son, Lucius Domitius, whose name became Nero as a result. His step- brother would later be married to his sister Octavia, and soon eclipsed him as Claudius' heir. Following his father's death in October 54, Nero became emperor. The sudden death of Britannicus shortly before his fourteenth birthday is reported by all extant sources as a poisoning on Nero's orders—as Claudius' natural son, he represented a threat to Nero's claim to the throne.

Germanicus (Latin: Germanicus Julius Caesar; 24 May 15 BC – 10 October AD 19) was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and a prominent general of the Roman Empire, who was known for his campaigns in Germania. The son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, Germanicus was born into an influential branch of the patrician gens Claudia. The agnomen Germanicus was added to his full name in 9 BC when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honor of his victories in Germania. In AD 4, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, Tiberius, who succeeded Augustus as Roman emperor a decade later. As a result, Germanicus became an official member of the gens Julia, another prominent family which he was related to on his mother's side. His connection to the Julii was further consolidated through a marriage between himself and Agrippina the Elder, a granddaughter of Augustus. He was also the nephew of Tiberius, the older brother of Claudius, the father of Caligula, and the maternal grandfather of Nero. During the reign of Augustus, Germanicus enjoyed an accelerated political career as the heir of the emperor's heir, entering the office of quaestor five years before the legal age in AD 7. He held that office until AD 11, and was elected consul for the first time in AD 12. The year after, he was made proconsul of Germania Inferior, Germania Superior, and all of Gaul. From there he commanded eight legions, about one-third of the entire Roman army, which he led against the Germanic tribes in his campaigns from AD 14 to 16. He avenged the Roman Empire's defeat in the Teutoburg Forest and retrieved two of the three legionary eagles that had been lost during the battle. In AD 17 he returned to Rome where he received a triumph before leaving to reorganize the provinces of Asia Minor, whereby he incorporated the provinces of Cappadocia and Commagene in AD 18. While in the eastern provinces, he came into conflict with the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. During their feud, Germanicus became ill in Antioch, where he died on 10 October AD 19. His death has been attributed to poison by ancient sources, but that was never proven. As a famous general, he was widely popular and regarded as the ideal Roman long after his death. To the Roman people, Germanicus was the Roman equivalent of Alexander the Great due to the nature of his death at a young age, his virtuous character, his dashing physique, and his military renown.

Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus (? – died around 32 B.C.) was a Roman statesman. Lucius Bibulus was the son of Julius Caesar's implacable enemy Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus and possibly, Porcia Catonis (daughter of Cato the Younger), although it is unlikely. His two elder brothers were killed in Egypt by some of the soldiery which Aulus Gabinius had left there after having restored Ptolemy Auletes to the throne. His father died in 48 BC from the exhaustion and strain of commanding the republican fleets against Caesar. After Caesar's murder, Lucius chose the side of Marcus Junius Brutus, Porcia's new husband, for whom he fought at the battle of Philippi. After the defeat of Caesar's murderers, he surrendered to Marcus Antonius who later gave him command of his fleet. Bibulus was later made governor of Syria by Augustus and he died around 32 BC.

919,"Sancha of Castile (–1179) was daughter of Alfonso VII of León and Castile and his first wife Berengaria of Barcelona. Sancha was the fifth child of seven born to her parents. On 20 July 1153, Sancha married Sancho VI of Navarre. He is responsible for bringing his kingdom into the political orbit of Europe. As la reyna de Navarra, filla del emperador (the queen of Navarre, daughter of the Emperor) her August 1179 death was reported in the Annales Toledanos.

Sancha of León (born 1191 or 1192) was the eldest child and daughter of Alfonso IX of León by his first wife, Theresa of Portugal. She was raised at the court of their father, but her younger sister Dulce and her brother Ferdinand were raised with their mother in Portugal after the annulment of their parents' marriage in 1195. Although in Castile it was customary for females to inherit, and Sancha's stepmother became queen, briefly, of Castile, in León female succession was barred, although her ancestor Urraca had been the first queen regnant of Western Europe. After the death of Sancha's brother (1214), Alfonso IX named his second son, also Ferdinand, his heir, bestowing on him the title infante (1216). In 1217, with the support of the aristocracy, Alfonso granted his daughters Sancha and Dulce the villages of Portela de San Juan, Burgo de Ribadavia and Allariz, to be ruled by them until their deaths, after which they would revert to the Crown. In that same year, Ferdinand's mother, Berengaria, inherited the Kingdom of Castile, but ceded it to her son, who was proclaimed king at Valladolid on 2 July. With his heir out of the kingdom and ruling in another place, Alfonso attempted to make his eldest daughters his joint heirs. In the Treaty of Boronal concluded with Portugal in 1219, Alfonso expressly states that if he should die, Portugal should respect the agreement with his daughters. Alfonso also attempted to secure his eldest daughter's rights by marrying her to John of Brienne, the former King of Jerusalem, but his wife Berengaria blocked this action in order to advance her son. In the spring of 1224, John was on the Way of Saint James, passing through Alfonso's kingdom, when he decided to stop in Toledo in order to see his prospective bride. There the queen convinced him instead to marry her daughter, Berengaria, and on his return trip, at Burgos, he did, his wife and he being accompanied as far as Logroño by the king and former queen of Castile. After this fiasco, Alfonso declared Sancha and Dulce his heirs, but upon his death on 24 September 1230, the people of León, who had pledged for Ferdinand in 1206, refused to recognise his daughters, and they in turn ceded their rights to his kingdom to their half-brother. She was 38 years old at the time. This agreement, negotiated at Valencia de Don Juan by Berengaria and Theresa, with Sancha and Dulce present, is known as the pact of the mothers. The treaty was signed Benavente and in compensation Ferdinand promised a yearly stipend of 30,000 maravedíes to each of his half-sisters and the lordship of certain castles.

Sancha of Aragon (1186–1241) was the daughter of King Alfonso II of Aragon and his wife, Sancha of Castile.

Sancha's paternal grandparents were Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona and Petronilla of Aragon; her maternal grandparents were Alfonso VII of León and Castile and Richeza of Poland, Queen of Castile. She was the sister of Peter II of Aragon and Alfonso II, Count of Provence. She had one child, Joan, Countess of Toulouse, who held the same titles as her mother from 1249 to 1271.

Nicolaus of Damascus (Greek: , Nikolos Damasknos; Latin: Nicolaus Damascenus) was a Jewish historian and philosopher who lived during the Augustan age of the Roman Empire. His name is derived from that of his birthplace, Damascus. He was born around 64 BC. Nicolaus is known to have had a brother named Ptolemy, who served in the court of Herod as a type of book-keeper or accountant. He was an intimate friend of Herod the Great, whom he survived by a number of years. He was also the tutor of the children of Mark Antony and Cleopatra (born in c.68 BC), according to Sophronius. He went to Rome with Herod Archelaus, to defend the young man's claim to the throne upon the death of his father Herod the Great.

His output was vast, but is nearly all lost. His chief work was a universal history in 144 books. He also wrote an autobiography, a life of Augustus, a life of Herod, some philosophical works, and some tragedies and comedies. There is an article on him in the Suda.

Wong Kar- wai( born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best- of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama As Tears Go By( 1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles.  Days of Being Wild( 1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time( 1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time- consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express( 1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046( 2004) and The Grandmaster( 2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

Guido Fubini (19 January 1879 – 6 June 1943) was an Italian mathematician, known for Fubini's theorem and the Fubini–Study metric. Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied differential geometry under Ulisse Dini and Luigi Bianchi. His 1900 doctoral thesis was about Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces. After earning his doctorate, he took up a series of professorships. In 1901 he began teaching at the University of Catania in Sicily; shortly afterwards he moved to the University of Genoa; and in 1908 he moved to the Politecnico in Turin and then the University of Turin, where he would stay for a few decades. During this time his research focused primarily on topics in mathematical analysis, especially differential equations, functional analysis, and complex analysis; but he also studied the calculus of variations, group theory, non-Euclidean geometry, and projective geometry, among other topics. With the outbreak of World War I, he shifted his work towards more applied topics, studying the accuracy of artillery fire; after the war, he continued in an applied direction, applying results from this work to problems in electrical circuits and acoustics. In 1939, when Fubini at the age of 60 was nearing retirement, Benito Mussolini's Fascists adopted the anti-Jewish policies advocated for several years by Adolf Hitler's Nazis. As a Jew, Fubini feared for the safety of his family, and so accepted an invitation by Princeton University to teach there; he died in New York City four years later. A main belt asteroid, 22495 Fubini, was named in his honour.

Wong Kar-wai (born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama  As Tears Go By (1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles. Days of Being Wild (1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express (1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards.

The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles.

Random Harvest is a 1942 film based on the 1941 James Hilton novel of the same name, directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Claudine West, George Froeschel, and Arthur Wimperis adapted the novel for the screen, and received an Academy Award nomination. The novel keeps the true identity of Paula/ Margaret a secret until the very end, something that would have been impossible in a film, where characters ’ faces must be seen. This meant that the movie had to take a very different approach to the story. The film stars Ronald Colman as a shellshocked, amnesiac World War I soldier, and Greer Garson as his love interest. It was an instant commercial success. Its seven Oscar nominations included nods for Colman, supporting actress Susan Peters, director Mervyn LeRoy, and Best Picture. Garson, whose performance was well- received, was ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Actress, as she had already been nominated that year for her role in Mrs. Miniver.

1001,"Maatkare B was a wife of pharaoh Osorkon I and the mother of the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C. Maatkare was the daughter of Psusennes II (also known as Pasebkhanut II). Maatkare is known from several sources. Her statuette of which only the base with a pair of feet is preserved (Marseille, Musée Borély no. 432) may be a re-used New Kingdom piece. A statue of the Nile-god - now in the British Museum (BM 8) - was dedicated by his son Shoshenq C, and he lists his parents as Osorkon I and Maatkare. Maatkare is called the King's Daughter of ... Har-Psusennes II, beloved of Amun. On a statue from the Karnak Cachette (Cairo Museum CG 42194), also dedicated by her son Shoshenq, Maatkare has the titles Prophetess of Hathor, Lady of Dendera, God's Mother of Harsomtus, and King's Daughter. A Karnak inscription on the seventh pylon names a woman called Maatkare, King's Daughter of Psusennes Beloved of Amun, and this is usually though to refer to Maatkare B.

Shepseskare or Shepseskara (Egyptian for Noble is the Soul of Ra) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty (2494–2345 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.

Anastasia is a 1956 American historical drama film directed by Anatole Litvak and written by Arthur Laurents. Set in interwar France, the film follows the story of a suicidal amnesiac( Ingrid Bergman), whose remarkable resemblance to the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia — the youngest daughter of the late Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, who is rumored to have survived the execution of her family — draws her into a plot devised by the former Russian White General Bounine( Yul Brynner) and his associates to swindle from the Grand Duchess an inheritance of £ 10 million. However, the ultimate hurdle to their plan is the exiled Russian aristocracy — in particular the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna( Helen Hayes) — whom their handpicked claimant must convince of her legitimacy if they wish for their scheme to succeed. The origins of Anastasia lie in a play written by Marcelle Maurette, which was in turn inspired by Anna Anderson, the most famous of the many Anastasia impostors who appeared after the death of the Imperial family in July 1918.

In The Wives of Henry VIII, Antonia Fraser suggests that, following their marriage, one reason Henry VIII disliked her daughter Anne so much was that, unlike his first two wives and many of the court ladies around him, Anne did not possess educational and musical accomplishments and was ill-equipped to function in the contentious English court. Duchess Maria herself appears not to have favored sending her daughter to England. She wrote in a later correspondence she loved her daughter so much that she was 'loath to suffer her to depart her'.

1026,"Rauni Mollberg (April 15, 1929 – October 11, 2007) was a Finnish film director who directed movies and TV movies. In 1963 Mollberg directed movies for YLE. He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera. Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song (1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically-charged, blood-soaked tale of a young village girl's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality (Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture (Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and independent festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles. During his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film  The Earth is a Sinful Song (1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier (1985) making it the 17th highest-grossing movie in the history of Finland.

Where did Louisa Garrett Anderson's mother die?",geneva switzerland,aldeburgh,0.19408230483531952,0.0,False
1027,"Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson, CBE (28 July 1873 – 15 November 1943) was a medical pioneer, a member of the Women's Social and Political Union, a suffragette, and social reformer. She was the daughter of the founding medical pioneer Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, whom she wrote a biography of in 1939. Louisa was the Chief Surgeon of the Women's Hospital Corps (WHC) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. Her aunt, Dame Millicent Fawcett, was a British suffragist. Louisa Garrett Anderson never married.

Sadie Crawford (1885–1965), also known as Sadie Johnson and Sadie Mozee, was a British-American performer of the early jazz era, one of the few white female performers of her day to have enjoyed an international career. Based for the last 35 years of her life in Washington, D.C., United States, she was born Louisa Harriet Marshall in Tooting, London on 27 December 1885. The youngest of the seven children of Francis Thomas Marshall and his wife Ellen Maria, she maintained a close bond with her siblings and their families throughout her life. The household in which she grew up was a somewhat unconventional one: her father, a removal-man, died just before her fifth birthday, and shortly afterwards her mother Ellen began a relationship with a man some 20 years her junior, Louis Slade, with whom in 1892 she went on to have one further child. Ellen and Louis finally married in 1905, four years before Ellen’s death. Most of Louisa’s siblings lived their adult lives in south London. Throughout her life she remained particularly close to her eldest sister Mrs Rhoda Matilda Newbon, who was mother to 13 children. Sadie took to the stage in London in her mid teens, and it is clear that early on she developed a taste for black popular culture, and music in particular. She would marry twice; both her husbands were black Americans. Numerous photographs show she presented herself as a 'black', 'coloured' or 'creole' woman and several newspaper articles also suggest that her origins were more exotic than they really were. Throughout her career she seems to have used professionally the forename Sadie, although the origins of this stage name are not known. Various sources allow us to piece together Sadie’s career. Not least among these is a short account of her life that she herself wrote in 1960 in her mid 70s. From this we learn that she left school at 11 (working initially as a domestic servant) and within a few years was employed as a dancer at London’s Empire Theatre. Her first big break came with an invitation from the American entertainer Laura Hampton (née Bowman) to join her review troupe, following which she was signed up for a European tour of the show 'A Trip to Coontown'. Sadie met her first husband, saxophonist Adolph Crawford, in 1906 and was soon working with him as a vaudeville music hall double act, although at this time she was using the name Sadie Johnson. In the years leading up to the First World War the duo can be found performing in Russia, Bucharest, the Balkan States and Scandinavia, as well as Berlin and Paris, and in the war years all corners of the United Kingdom. Sadie and Adolph finally married in Southwark in June 1918, just as the jazz craze was sweeping across Europe. Their international careers started to take off in earnest at this time, with invitations to tour the world pouring in. In the post-war years they can be found as far afield as New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, in addition to Austria, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Paris, very much the European capital of jazz with so many resident and ad hoc bands and orchestras, became an important base for the duo. It was in Paris in 1923 that the few recordings to feature them (as part of Gordon Stretton’s ‘Orchestre Syncopated Six’) were made by Pathé; it was also at the American Hospital of Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, that Adolph Crawford died in 1929. Within a few months of Adolph's death Sadie sailed to New York City with Lew Leslie's ‘Blackbirds’ and it was in the United States that she thereafter settled. After suffering a nervous breakdown she was advised to go to Saratoga Springs to recuperate and it was there she met her second husband Frank Mozee (a chauffeur, some 16 years younger than she was), whom she married in 1930, when she would have been 44. Sadie and Frank made their home in Washington D.C. and it seems that her second marriage effectively marked the end of her stage career. From America she regularly visited her family back in Tooting (in the early years by boat but latterly by plane), staying at the Regent Palace Hotel in central London. Although she had no children of her own, Sadie was ‘foster mother’ to a daughter, Lillian Brown. Sadie Mozee died at Washington’s District of Columbia General Hospital on 18 December 1965, a few days short of her 80th birthday, the Washington Evening Star revealing in her obituary notice that her death occurred ‘after a long illness’. The article also states that she was a member of St Martin’s Catholic Church and that she is buried in Washington's Mount Olivet Cemetery. Her husband Frank died in Washington D.C. in 1981.

Philip Kaufman (born October 23, 1936) is an American film director and screenwriter who has directed fifteen films over a career spanning more than six decades. He has been described as a maverick and an iconoclast, notable for his versatility and independence. He is considered an auteur, whose films have always expressed his personal vision. Kaufman's works have included genres such as realism, horror, fantasy, erotica, Westerns, underworld crime, and inner city gangs. His choice of topics has been eclectic and sometimes controversial, having adapted novels with diverse themes and stories. Examples are Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), Michael Crichton's Rising Sun (1993), a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), and the erotic writings of Anaïs Nin's Henry & June. His film The Wanderers (1979) has achieved cult status. But his greatest success was Tom Wolfe's true-life The Right Stuff, which received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. According to film historian Annette Insdorf, no other living American director has so consistently and successfully made movies for adults, tackling sensuality, artistic creation, and manipulation by authorities. Other critics note that Kaufman's films are strong on mood and atmosphere, with powerful cinematography and a lyrical, poetic style to portray different historic periods. His later films have a somewhat European style, but the stories always stress individualism and integrity, and are clearly American.

The idea, according to a press release written by Chaplin after the film received a negative reception, resulted from a visit I made to Shanghai in 1931 where I came across a number of titled aristocrats who had escaped the Russian Revolution. They were destitute and without a country, their status was of the lowest grade. The men ran rickshaws and the women worked in ten -cent dance halls. When the Second World War broke out many of the old aristocrats had died and the younger generation migrated to Hong Kong where their plight was even worse, for Hong Kong was overcrowded with refugees. It was originally started as a film called Stowaway in the 1930s, planned for Paulette Goddard, but production was never completed. This resulting film, created nearly 30 years after its inception, was a critical failure and grossed US$ 2 million from a US$3.5- million budget. However, it did prove to be extremely successful in Europe and Japan. In addition, the success of the music score was able to cover the budget. Critics such as Tim Hunter and Andrew Sarris, as well as poet John Betjeman and director François Truffaut, viewed the film as being among Chaplin's best works. Actor Jack Nicholson is also a big fan of the film. The film's theme song, This Is My Song, written by Chaplin and performed by Petula Clark, became a worldwide success, topping the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, while reaching number three in the United States and number four in Canada.

John Marcellus Huston (August 5, 1906 – August 28, 1987) was an American film director, screenwriter, actor, and visual artist. Huston was a citizen of the United States by birth but renounced U.S. citizenship to become an Irish citizen and resident. He returned to the United States, where he lived the rest of his life. He wrote the screenplays for most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics: The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The African Queen (1951), The Misfits (1961), Fat City (1972), The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and Prizzi's Honor (1986). During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, winning twice, and directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston, to Oscar wins. Huston studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris in his early years. He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career, sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, with little editing needed. Some of Huston's films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting an heroic quest, as in Moby Dick, or The Red Badge of Courage. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed, forming destructive alliances, giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his films involved themes such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, and war. Huston has been referred to as a titana rebel, and a renaissance man in the Hollywood film industry. Author Ian Freer describes him as cinema's Ernest Hemingway—a filmmaker who was never afraid to tackle tough issues head on.

1101,"Ælfwynn was the ruler of Mercia for a few months in 918, following her mother's death on 12 June 918. She was the daughter of Æthelred, ruler of English Mercia, and Æthelflæd( styled The Lady of Mercia). The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle states that she was deprived of all control in Mercia, and was led into Wessex three weeks before Christmas. Her accession was the only example of rule passing from one woman to another in the early medieval period in the British Isles.

Æthelswith (c. 838–888) was the only known daughter of King Æthelwulf of Wessex. She became Queen Æthelswith when she married King Burgred of Mercia in 853. The couple had no issue. Her marriage probably signalled the subordination of Burgred to his father-in-law and the Saxon kingdom at a time when both Wessex and Mercia were suffering Danish (Viking) raids. Burgred also had ongoing problems with the Kingdom of Powys on his western border and in 853 Æthelwulf subjugated the Welsh state on Burgred's behalf. Repeated Danish incursions over the years gradually weakened Mercia militarily and in 868 Burgred was forced to call upon Æthelswith's brother King Æthelred of Wessex to assist him in confronting an entrenched Danish army at Nottingham. This was the last time the Saxons came to the aid of the Mercians and is also notable as the occasion on which Alfred the Great, another brother of Æthelswith's, married his Mercian wife Ealhswith. Burgred's reign lasted till 874 when the Vikings drove him from the kingdom and he fled to Rome with Æthelswith. He died shortly after. Æthelswith lived on in Italy, to be buried at Pavia in 888.

The band members have included vocalist Maria Del Mar, guitarist Mark Crossley, guitarist Tim Welch, bassist Mark Storm, saxophonist Chris Weiss and drummer Garry Flint. The band came together after a chance meeting between Del Mar and Storm in an alley during a party in Toronto, Ontario; that initial meeting was actually an argument about musical taste, because Storm was a fan of gothic rock bands such as Bauhaus, while del Mar was into Spanish classical music, Motown, swing music and punk rock. Maria del Mar worked the coat check at Toronto nightclub The Diamond, while Tim Welch was the lighting technician there. Six months later, they released a self-titled independent EP, before signing to Intrepid Records in 1987. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1988, and spawned the radio single Flesh Under Skin. In 1989, their single and video for 68 Hours garnered them a CASBY Award. Their follow-up album, Courage was recorded in England with producer Zeus B. Held, and was released in 1990. The album was supported by a cross-Canada tour, and gave the band further radio airplay for the singles Shine On and Sex Gorilla. (The latter title was a band in-joke. The song had actually been written as Sarsparilla, but the fans kept misunderstanding the lyrics, so the band relented and retitled the song.) Sex Gorilla also led to a fan tradition of throwing bananas at the stage during their shows. The band subsequently left Capitol Records, and released their third and final album Wildseed in 1995 on the independent label Iron Music. Despite frequent confusion, Del Mar is not the same person as television actress Maria del Mar. She has continued to work in the Toronto music scene, including gigs with Classic Albums Live and with the Rolling Stones tribute band Midnight Ramblers. Storm was reported missing in November 2002. The following June, his body was found in Lake Ontario. The band has performed periodically, including shows at Toronto's Bovine Sex Club in 2011 and 2012, and continue to perform at select venues.

Austen Kark CBE (20 October 1926 – 10 May 2002) was a managing director of the BBC World Service. He was one of three former holders of that post, along with Gerard Mansell and John Tusa, to oppose the plans of John Birt to merge the service into the BBC. After Birt became director general of the BBC in 1992, he had planned to end the service's independent status at Bush House in central London, and absorb it within the rest of the corporation. Kark led a varied career before his tenure with the BBC. He was the son of a London army major who became a publisher. He attended Upper Canada College in Toronto, the Nautical College in Pangbourne, the Royal Naval College, and Magdalen College, Oxford. He became a Royal Navy midshipman in 1944, serving two years with the East Indies fleet, aboard and HMS London. In 1948 at Oxford, Kark directed the first production of Jean-Paul Sartre's The Flies. He later joined his family's magazine business, Norman Kark Publications. One of its magazines was the glossy literary magazine Courier. Kark married Margaret Schmahmann in 1949; they had two daughters. The couple divorced in 1954. Kark married novelist Nina Bawden the same year and became stepfather to her two sons. They had one daughter. He became a BBC reporter in 1954 and became head of the South European service at Bush House in 1964. His experiences in South Europe fuelled his interest in the region, particularly Greece; he would later write guidebooks about the country. Kark moved to the East European and Russian service in 1972. The following year he became Editor of the World Service. He advised the last governor of Rhodesia, Lord Soames, on broadcasting the 1979 election in that country. He became controller of engineering services in 1974. In 1980, he chaired the Harare government report on radio and television in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe. In 1981 he began a two-year tenure as Deputy Managing Director of External Broadcasting. He was promoted to Managing Director in 1984, exactly 30 years after he joined the BBC. Kark was the man-in-the-middle of another great BBC controversy – the launching of the BBC World television service to complement its radio counterpart. The idea was first mooted by Kark's predecessor, Douglas Muggeridge – the nephew of the broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge. Kark retired in 1986. Kark was a man of broad interests, especially involving southern Europe and the Commonwealth. He became a trustee of the Commonwealth Journalists' Association in 1993. In retirement, he wrote Attic in Greece (1994), and The Forwarding Agent (1999), a spy thriller set in the Middle East that was praised by the crime writer PD James, an old friend. Most of his book was written at his home in Nauplion, a small town in the Peloponnese, where he and his wife Bawden spent much of their time. In London, the couple lived in Islington, in a house backing on to the Grand Union Canal. His hobbies included real tennis, travelling and studying mosaics. He was a member of the Oriental Club and MCC, and was appointed CBE in 1987. Austen Kark died at the age of 75 in the Potters Bar rail crash, in which his wife was severely injured.

The Master of Ambrass was a Bohemian painter active probably in Prague at the end of the fourteenth century. He was the creator of the Wiener Musterbuch, a set of silverpoint studies and subjects all dated to the same period, which were used as models in painters' studios. Among the subjects are bust- length images of Christ, the Virgin, various saints, the Crucifixion, and the Annunciation. The pictures are collected in groups of four, affixed to fourteen small framed panels. Three independent designs also exist, depicting a philosopher and astronomer, a sibyl and John the Evangelist, and the Three Magi; these, too, were probably part of the set. Such is the realism of the designs that it is believed the Master had contact with an artist of the Franco- Flemish school. Also attributed to his hand, dubiously, is an Annunciation at the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Stylistically, the Master's work bears some similarities to that of the Master of the Pähl Altarpiece. He is sometimes conflated with both the Master of the Gerona Martyrology and the Master of the Rajhrad Altarpiece, but this attribution is not universally accepted.

The first Dominican site in England was at Oxford, in the parishes of St. Edward and St. Adelaide. The friars built an oratory to the Blessed Virgin Mary and by 1265, the brethren, in keeping with their devotion to study, began erecting a school. Actually, the Dominican brothers likely began a school immediately after their arrival, as priories were legally schools. Information about the schools of the English Province is limited, but a few facts are known. Much of the information available is taken from visitation records. The visitation was a section of the province through which visitors to each priory could describe the state of its religious life and its studies to the next chapter. There were four such visits in England and Wales—Oxford, London, Cambridge and York. All Dominican students were required to learn grammar, old and new logic, natural philosophy and theology. Of all of the curricular areas, however, theology was the most important. This is not surprising when one remembers Dominic's zeal for it.

Adémar II de Poitiers, known in Old Occitan as Ademar or Aimeric de Peiteus, was the count of Valentinois and de facto ruler of Diois from 1188 or 1189 until 1230. He was the son of Count Guillaume and grandson of Count Adémar I. He married Philippa, daughter of Guillaume- Jourdain, the lord of Fay, and Météline de Clérieu. The Finnish scholar Aimo Sakari hypothesised that Philippa of Fay was the famous trobairitz known as the Comtessa de Dia, and that the friend( amic) mentioned by the Comtessa in her poems was the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras. Around 1195 – 96, Adémar himself participated in a three- way torneyamen( a type of collaborative poem) with Raimbaut de Vaqueiras and Perdigon. On 4 May 1187, Adémar joined his father in making a donation to the charterhouse of La Sylve- Bénite. After his father's death, Adémar received a letter from the Emperor Frederick I, written at Lyon on 21 July 1188, warning him to cease levying tolls in the Diois, which were illegal under certain privileges the emperor had extended to the bishops of Die. In March 1189, Adémar granted a charter of liberties to his vassal, Silvion, the lord of Crest, who controlled the valley between Valentinois and Diois. An inscription in marble was made of this charter and survives. In it Adémar refers to himself as Ademar of Poitiers, count of Valentinois. Bishop Robert of Die, who had made the complaint to the emperor about Adémar's tolls, was the major witness of this charter of liberties. In June 1189, Count Raymond V of Toulouse—in his capacity as margrave of Provence—and Adémar signed an agreement whereby the former renounced his rights in the Diois in return for the latter's fealty and homage. This is probably the occasion on which Adémar broke with the lords of Baux, and alluded to in the poem Leus sonetz si cum suoill by the Raimbaut de Vaqueiras. It was not, however, the occasion upon which the counts of Valentinois began calling themselves counts of Diois, a title rightly belonging to the bishops. The counts of Valentinois had long quarrelled and vied for power with their neighbours, counts of Albon. In 1191, Countess Beatrice of Albon, who was married to Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, signed a pact with Guillaume de Clérieu l' Abbé against Adémar. In 1192, Adémar confirmed a donation the count of Toulouse made at Léoncel, and in 1196 he granted the town a charter of liberties. In 1193, on the occasion of the consecration of the church of Montmeyran by Bishop Falco of Valence, the count of Valentinois granted it and its prior, Ponce, some of his vassals, without effecting the freedoms and exemptions they enjoyed under him. In 1197 Adémar and Philippa made a donation to the charterhouse of Bonnefoy, which her father had founded in 1156. When he made a donation to the priory of Rompont on 31 January 1202, the day of his son Guillaume's birth, he asked God to preserve his child's life so that he could work for the glory and good of the church. Ademar sought to take more control of local lands from William of Savoy, bishop of Valence. Silvion of Crest sought the support of the bishop against Ademar, and the bishop led forces which captured many of Ademar's men. There was an initial peace treaty in 1227, with a more final treaty concluded in 1231. Ademar had at least one son, William( Guillaume), who married Flotte de Royans and had a son, Ademar III. William died in 1227, and the fate of his widow and son were a key part in the resolution of the conflict with William of Savoy. Ultimately, she remarried to Aymon II de Faucigny.

It was produced by former Motown songwriter and producer Norman Whitfield for Whitfield Records. Lead vocals were sung by Gwen Dickey and the song was released as the second single from their third studio album Strikes Again.

Madonna's version was included in her second studio album Like a Virgin( 1984), and it was the idea of Michael Ostin, the head of the A&R department of Warner Bros. Records, that Madonna record a cover version of the song to include in the album. A remix of Madonna's cover was included in her 1995 ballad compilation album Something to Remember. The original and the remixed version of the Madonna song differ in that the latter uses more classical instruments. The 1995 version also received a number of club remix treatments. Critics were not impressed with the version present in Like a Virgin, calling it awful, while they warmed to the version present in Something to Remember. However, it was a commercial disappointment, reaching a peak of only 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was promoted by a music video shot by Jean- Baptiste Mondino, which portrayed Madonna in an empty suite of an abandoned hotel, and was shot in a single take.

Koyaanisqatsi , also known as Koyaanisqatsi: Life Out of Balance, is a 1982 American experimental film directed by Godfrey Reggio with music composed by Philip Glass and cinematography by Ron Fricke. The film consists primarily of slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States. The visual tone poem contains neither dialogue nor a vocalized narration: its tone is set by the juxtaposition of images and music. Reggio explained the lack of dialogue by stating it's not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words. It's because, from my point of view, our language is in a state of vast humiliation. It no longer describes the world in which we live.  In the Hopi language, the word Koyaanisqatsi means unbalanced life. The film is the first in the Qatsi film trilogy: it is succeeded by Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002). The trilogy depicts different aspects of the relationship between humans, nature and technology. Koyaanisqatsi is the best known of the trilogy and is considered a cult film. However, because of copyright issues, the film was out of print for most of the 1990s.

By marriage she became Duchess of Norfolk. Her abusive marriage to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, created a public scandal.

Thomas Stafford, 3rd Earl of Stafford (c. 1368–4 July 1392) was the second son—but the senior surviving heir—of Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford and Philippa de Beauchamp, daughter of Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick. His elder brother, his father's heir, Sir Ralph Stafford, was murdered by Richard II's half-brother, the earl of Huntingdon whilst they were campaigning in Scotland in July 1385. As a result, Thomas became heir to the earldom of Stafford, and in 1390 he was knighted. He gained livery of his estates in 1391 and paid homage to the king for them on 20 October that year. He spent his short career campaigning in France alongside the duke of Gloucester. Thomas Stafford married Anne, daughter of Thomas, Duke of Gloucester around 1390.

Archie Prince Albert Hunt( December 20, 1896- March 21, 1931) from Denton, Texas was an American country blues fiddle player. He was one of the founders of the musical genre later defined as Western swing. Hunt was born as Archie Albert Hunt in Terrell, Texas to Archibald Hunt and Manasa Emma Lee Skates, both of whom were blues musicians. As a child, he learned to play the fiddle by stealing his father's instrument and self- teaching himself in a nearby graveyard. Though much of Hunt's personal life is obscure, it is known he served in the First World War, and his first professional work as a musician was as a member in a traveling minstrel show, in the early 1920s. On March 28, 1928, Hunt and his group, the Texas Ramblers, which included violinist Harmon Clem and an unknown guitarist, recorded in San Antonio for Okeh Records. Of the sides the group laid down, Blues in the Bottle was arguably his most accomplished for its diverse assortment of country blues, ragtime and old- time music. It was later included in Rich Nevins' compilation album, Times Ai n’t Like They Used to Be, Volume 1 along with other contemporaries. In addition to being a recording artist, Hunt regularly performed on local radio stations and venues, usually in blackface, with his neighbors Doc and Oscar Harper. Hunt particularly favored the neighborhood known as Deep Ellum, which was also frequented by other blues musicians, but notorious for its red-light district. On June 26, 1929, Hunt and the Texas Ramblers recorded for the last time, with the session taking place in Dallas. Among the six songs recorded was Wake Up, Jacob which was featured on the renowned compilation created by Harry Everett Smith, Anthology of American Folk Music, in 1952. An unknown composition was cut, but was either never released or no original copies exist. The song, Oklahoma Rag was released as under Prince Albert Hunt and Hermon Clem. The recordings were later seen as a primary influence in Western swing and country music in general. On 31 March 1931 Hunt was shot to death outside Confederate Hall. His assailant, William M. Douglas, reported that he murdered Hunt out of jealousy for dancing with his wife. In 1974, a documentary titled Memories of Prince Albert Hunt was released and was centered on the musician's life.

Conrad married Ingeborg, the daughter of Count Gerhard IV of Holstein-Plön. They had four children: Conrad I of Oldenburg is also a male-line ancestor of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, King Harald V of Norway, and of Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and thus of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.

Conrad II (4 June 1039), also known as and , was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire from 1027 until his death in 1039. The founder of the Salian dynasty of emperors who ruled for over a century, Conrad also served as King of Germany from 1024, King of Italy from 1026, and King of Burgundy (Arelat) from 1033. The son of a mid-level nobleman in Franconia, Count Henry of Speyer and Adelaide of Metz, he inherited the titles of count of Speyer and of Worms as an infant when his father died. Conrad extended his power beyond his inherited lands, receiving the favor of the princes of the Kingdom of Germany. When the Saxon-based Ottonian dynasty of emperors died off with the childless Emperor Henry II, Conrad was elected to succeed him as King in 1024 at the age of 34. Conrad continued the policies and achievements of the Ottonian Henry II regarding the Catholic Church and the affairs of Italy. Conrad continued to build the Church as a center for imperial power, preferring to appoint church bishops over secular lords to important posts across the Empire. Like Henry II before him, Conrad also continued a policy of benign neglect over Italy, especially for the city of Rome. His reign marked a high point of the medieval imperial rule and a relatively peaceful period for the Empire. Following the death of the childless King Rudolph III of Burgundy in 1032, Conrad claimed dominion over the Kingdom of Arles and conquered and incorporated it into the Empire. The three kingdoms (Germany, Italy, and Burgundy) formed the basis of the Empire as the royal triadregna tria).

Arne Mattsson (2 December 1919 - 28 June 1995) was a Swedish film director, born in Uppsala. His early movies were mostly comedies. His biggest success was Hon dansade en sommar (1951, aka.  One Summer of Happiness), which earned him the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and a nomination for the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952. It caused some controversy at the time because it contained nudity. His 1953 film of Peder Sjögren's second novel, Bread of LoveKärlekens bröd), based on Sjögren's experiences as a volunteer in the Finnish Continuation War of 1941-44 angered the author, was banned in Finland and incurred the wrath of the Soviets at the Cannes Film Festival. In spite of all this, Sjögren grudgingly admitted that as a study of men under severe pressure it was impressive. In 1958 he directed Damen i svart, the first in the series of five Hillman-thrillers, centred on Folke Mellvig's crime-solving middle-class city couple Kajsa and John Hillman. The second in the series, Mannekäng i rött (1958), is considered by some to be a precursor of the Italian giallo films, notably Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace. The popularity of his mystery movies declined and in the 1970s and 1980s he made mostly low-budget thrillers - some in collaboration with Mats Helge Olsson - which got mostly bad reviews.

Gwladys was named the star of Abergavenny Gwladys the happy and the faultless by Welsh poet Lewys Glyn Cothi. He describes the lady of Raglan Castle, which she became upon her second marriage, as a brilliant being, like the sun—the pavilion of light. She has been compared to the legendary Queen Marcia for her discretion and influence.

Saint Gwladys ferch Brychan or St Gladys (Latin-Gladusa), daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog, was the queen of the saint-king Gwynllyw Milwr and the mother of Cadoc the Wise, whose vita may be the earliest saint's life to mention Arthur. Gwladys's other children were Cynidr, Bugi, Cyfyw, Maches, Glywys II and Egwine. Today her main church and associated school is in Bargoed.

Gwladys ferch Dafydd was the daughter of Dafydd ap Gruffudd, the last free Prince of Wales, and Elizabeth Ferrers.

Kidane Kale (reigned c. 1718 - c. 1744; literal meaning:  Beginning, Word), better known as Abuye, was a Meridazmach of Shewa, an important Amhara noble of Ethiopia. He was the son of Sebestyanos. Abir states that he ruled for 25 years, although noting that Harris claims he ruled for 15 years, Coulbeaux for 25 (from 1725 to 1750), and d'Hericourt for 60. His wife was Woizero Tagunestiya, daughter of Mama Rufa'el, Governor of Mamameder. Abuye succeeded on the death of his father, and made his capital at Har Amba. Sebestyanos had died by a curious accident, according to Levine. Abuye had been rebuilding some of the churches destroyed by Ahmad Gragn, one of which was in Doqaqit dedicated to St. Michael. Part of the ceremony required the tabot in the church in 'Ayne, where his father was living, and it was secretly removed to Doqaqit. Sebestyanos saw this as an act of rebellion, and set forth to capture and discipline his son; however, in the ensuing battle one of Qedami Qal's servants accidentally killed the Meridazmach. Because his father Sebestyanos refused to give homage to the Emperor of Ethiopia, shortly after Abuye came to power he was confronted with an attack by the army of Emperor Iyasus II. Although Abuye survived this threat unharmed, sources differ on the details. Abir reports one version, that intermediaries arranged an agreement where in exchange for tribute Abuye was officially invested with the title of Meridazmach; Marcus elaborates on this version, adding that Emperor Iyasu was more concerned about suppressing the Wollo Oromo closer to his center of power.
