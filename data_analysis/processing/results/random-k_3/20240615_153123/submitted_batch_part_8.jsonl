By the time the first subway opened, the lines had been consolidated into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn -- Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). Many present lines were built under the Dual Contracts, and after 1913, all lines built for the IRT and most other lines built or improved for the BRT were built by the city and leased to the companies. The first line of the city - owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended to compete with the private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down. However, it was kept within the core of the city because of the low amount of startup capital provided to the municipal Board of Transportation by the state. This required it to be run ``at cost '', necessitating fares up to double the five - cent fare popular at the time.\n\nWhich film whose director was born first, Sword Of The Empire or Seven Guns For Timothy?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Supplied by the Soviet Union, from late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan.

The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz bombing campaign, and the Balkan Campaign, as well as the long - running Battle of the Atlantic.

Chen is a Taiwanese former basketball player and coach.\n\nJugraj Singh\nJugraj Singh( born 22 April 1983) is a former Indian field hockey player whose playing career was cut short by a 2003 car accident. Born in 1983 to a Sikh family in Punjab, the former Punjab policeman was a self- coached, drag- flicker defender who later became a coach. A product of the Surjeet Singh Hockey Academy in Jalandhar and the Air India Hockey Academy in Delhi, Singh played left fullback for the Punjab Police team in Jalandhar; he made his international debut in the 2001 under- 18 Asia Cup in Ipoh. Singh was not the only field- hockey player in his family; his older sister Rajbeer Kaur Rai is a former India captain and recipient of the Arjuna Award, and his brother- in- law Gurmail Singh played on the 1980 Olympic team. Singh played a pivotal role in taking Indian field hockey to a higher level by winning the Junior World Cup, the 2003 Indo- Pak Champions Trophy and the Asian Championship. He was considered to be the next Sohail Abbas by many experts; in a series against Pakistan, he performed so well that Abbas said he could see a younger version of himself in Singh. After his accident Singh attempted a comeback on the national team; however, he never went further than the probables list despite playing for the Chandigarh Dynamos with a decent record in the PHL. He was given an opportunity to coach the junior national team for penalty corners at the national camp. Singh picked four players from that team, one of whom is the renowned drag- flicker Rupinder Pal Singh. \" I did not achieve this overnight. My drag flick coach Jugraj has worked hard for that. I owe my success to him,\" Rupinder said. He added\" Sohail Abbas is brilliant drag flicker. He has the world record against his name but if Jugraj did not meet with an accident in 2003, he might have been the record holder\". Singh is the penalty- corners coach of the Indian men's national team. With his coaching, India qualified for the London Olympics 2012 with Chief Coach Michael Nobbs. In the qualifiers, India's penalty- corner conversion ratio was very high because of Sandeep Singh and V. R. Raghunath. In the qualifying final, India defeated France 8 \u2013 1. Of the eight goals, six( of seven attempts) were scored on penalty corners; five of the six penalty- corner goals were scored by Sandeep Singh.\n\nWhere was the place of death of George Of Lencastre, 2Nd Duke Of Aveiro's father?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

One of the most prominent incidents during Yejong's reign was the trial and death of General Nam I (\ub0a8\uc774 \uc7a5\uad70, \u5357\u6021). Nam-I was famous for having suppressed Yi Si-ae rebellion along with General Gang-Sun and others. At age 28, he was appointed to Minister of War. However, when Yejong became king, a minister named Yu Jagwang (\uc720\uc790\uad11, \u67f3\u5b50\u5149) who was jealous of Nam I accused him of treason when he found out that Yejong himself was not fond of Nam I.

Chiang led the Northern Expedition through China with the intention of defeating the warlords and unifying the country. Chiang received the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party; however, he soon dismissed his Soviet advisors. He was convinced, not without reason, that they wanted to get rid of the KMT (also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party) and take over. Chiang decided to strike first and purged the Communists, killing thousands of them. At the same time, other violent conflicts took place in the south of China where the Communist Party fielded superior numbers and were massacring Nationalist supporters. These events eventually led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party. Chiang Kai - shek pushed the Communist Party into the interior as he sought to destroy them, and moved the Nationalist Government to Nanjing in 1927. Leftists within the KMT still allied to the communists, lead by Wang Jingwei, had established a rival Nationalist Government in Wuhan two months earlier, but soon joined Chiang in Nanjing in August 1927. By the following year, Chiang's army had captured Beijing after overthrowing the Beiyang government and unified the entire nation, at least nominally, marking the beginning the Nanjing Decade.\n\nWho is Ermengarde Of Tuscany's paternal grandfather?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

As his father's eldest son and heir to his father's title he was known as (styled) Marquess of Worcester, a courtesy title. On his father's death on 24 April 1714 he succeeded him and became 3rd Duke of Beaufort.

In 1742 he filed for divorce due to Frances' adulterous relationship with William Talbot, who later became Earl Talbot. Frances countersued, saying the Duke was impotent; in March 1743, he demonstrated before court-appointed examiners that he was physically able to have an erection. The divorce was granted, and he sued Talbot for damages. Frances later remarried to Charles FitzRoy-Scudamore. The Duke was one of several founding governors of Britain's first institution for abandoned children, the Foundling Hospital, and his name is listed in its royal charter received from George II in October 1739.

She is considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first country music artists to successfully crossover into pop music. Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country and Western Sides chart. Cline's first professional performances began at the local WINC radio station when she was fifteen. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on Connie B. Gay's \"Town and Country\" television broadcasts. It also led to the signing of her first recording contract with the Four Star label in 1954. She had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including \"A Church, A Courtroom and Goodbye\" (1955) and \"I've Loved and Lost Again\" (1956). In 1957 however, Cline made her first national television appearance on \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\". After performing \"Walkin' After Midnight\", the single would become her first major hit on both the country and pop charts. Cline's further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. After marrying in 1957 and giving birth in 1958, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline would become a member of the Grand Ole Opry and then move to Decca Records in 1960. Under the direction of producer Owen Bradley, her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single \"I Fall to Pieces\" would become her first to top the \"Billboard\" country chart. As the song became a hit, Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After recovering, her next single release \"Crazy\" would also become a major hit. Between 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with \" She's Got YouWhen I Get Through with YouSo Wrong\" and \"Leavin' on Your Mind\". She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. In March 1963, Cline appeared at a benefit show in Kansas City, Missouri. To return home, she boarded a plane along with country performers Cowboy Copas, Hawkshaw Hawkins and manager Randy Hughes. Upon hitting rough weather, the plane crashed outside of Camden, Tennessee, killing all those on board. Since her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres. She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In the 1980s, Cline's posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic \"Sweet Dreams\" starring Jessica Lange. Several documentaries and stage shows were released during this time, including the 1988 musical \" Always... Patsy Cline\". A 1991 box set of her recordings was issued that received critical acclaim. Her greatest hits album sold over 10 million copies in 2005. In 2011, Cline's childhood home was restored as a museum for visitors and fans to tour.\n\nWho was born first, Jo\u00e3o De Aquino or Yacine Slatni?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

As many of the Mill Creek valley's earliest settlers were of German descent, Old Pine Church may also have been built as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents, known as\" Dunkers\" or\" Dunkards\". The church is believed to have also been a meeting place for German Methodist settlers. By 1870, the church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination, and in 1878, the church's congregation split into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church congregations. Both congregations continued to use the church until 1907. Old Pine Church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship. In 1968, residents of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to perform a restoration of the church. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, due to its\" significant settlement- era rural religious architecture in the Potomac Highlands.\" The church is a large, one- story, gablefront log building sheathed in brown- painted wooden German siding. The original hewn log beams are visible beneath the church, with some bark remaining on the logs. The church's interior ceiling measures approximately in height and is clad in pressed metal panels.

He was of Pennsylvania Dutch descent and resided for much of his life in Brooklyn, New York. A self- described\" able C man\", Fackenthal graduated from Boys High School in 1902 before earning his undergraduate degree from Columbia College in 1906. As a student, his prodigious administrative abilities( reflected by his leadership in various campus organizations, including the Varsity Show and the\" Columbia Daily Spectator\") were recognized by president Nicholas Murray Butler, leading to his career as chief clerk( 1906 \u2013 1910), secretary( 1910 \u2013 1937), and provost( 1937 \u2013 1948) of the University. As secretary and provost, he was the\" de facto\" administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes from their inception until 1948; following his retirement, he received a special Prize in recognition of his service. Previously, Fackenthal received an honorary LL.D. from Franklin& Marshall College( a recipient of familial philanthropy) and an honorary Litt.D. from Columbia in 1929. Although he never completed an earned graduate degree, he was frequently characterized in the press thereafter as\" Dr. Fackenthal.\" He later received honorary doctorates from Syracuse University, Rutgers University, New York University and Union College. Between the retirement of Nicholas Murray Butler in 1945 and the installation of Dwight D. Eisenhower as president in 1948, Fackenthal served as acting president while retaining his post as provost. Although several trustees considered motioning for his permanent appointment, this was forestalled by the ailing Butler, who considered Fackenthal( whom he publicly deprecated as\" my clerk\") to be unworthy of the position. Despite this acrimony, Fackenthal was elected to the university's board of trustees against Butler's wishes in 1946 in an unprecedented breach of longstanding tradition. As acting president, Fackenthal developed a plan for Columbia's continued growth that was\" largely eschewed by his successors\", presaging the tumult of Grayson Kirk's administration and the Columbia University protests of 1968. He also oversaw the formation of the School of General Studies( for nontraditional undergraduates and nonmatriculated students), the graduate- level School of International Affairs and the Harriman Institute. Following his retirement from the University in 1948, he served as educational consultant to the Carnegie Corporation( 1948 \u2013 1952) and then as president of Columbia University Press( 1953 \u2013 1958). He also served as president of the Bushwick Savings Bank and remained a trustee of various institutions, including Columbia, Barnard College, Franklin and Marshall College and the Riverdale Country School. His principal speeches as acting president were published by Columbia University Press as\" The Greater Power and Other Addresses\"( 1949). In December 1965, he was critically injured when his car collided with a truck in White Township, New Jersey, 35 miles south of his country home in Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania. As a result of his injuries, Fackenthal( who never married and had no legitimate children) was forced to permanently relocate from Brooklyn to Buck Hill Falls.
