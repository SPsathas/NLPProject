Emperor Ruizong of Tang (22 June 662 – 13 July 716), personal name Li Dan, also known at times during his life as Li Xulun, Li Lun, Wu Lun, and Wu Dan, was the fifth and ninth emperor of Tang Dynasty. He was the eighth son of Emperor Gaozong and the fourth son of Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (During the first period, he did not rule the, and the entire government In the hands of to his mother, Empress Wu, later as Wu Zetian Is known Was). In February 684, Li Dan's mother Empress Wu demoted his older brother Emperor Zhongzong (Li Xian) who had attempted to rule free of his mother, and named him emperor (as Emperor Ruizong). Emperor Ruizong, however, was a puppet under control of his mother and did not have any real power. In October 690 he ceded the imperial throne to his mother, who installed herself as empress regnant – the only woman in Chinese history ever to rule as empress regnant. Emperor Ruizong was reduced to the position of crown prince, with the unconventional title of ""Huangsi"" (皇嗣, ""imperial successor""). In the following years, Empress Wu's nephews Wu Chengsi and Wu Sansi tried to have one of them named heir to the throne, but Wu Zetian resisted these calls. Eventually, in October 698, faced with foreign invasion and dissatisfaction at home, Empress Wu accepted the suggestion of the chancellor Di Renjie and recalled the exiled Li Xian to the capital Luoyang. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the position of crown prince to his elder brother, and Li Xian became crown prince instead. In 705, a coup overthrew Wu Zetian and restored Emperor Zhongzong to the throne. The five years of Emperor Zhongzong's reign were dominated by Zhongzong's empress consort, Empress Wei. In the beginning of July 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei who then named Zhongzong's youngest son Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen emperor (as Emperor Shang). A mere two weeks later, Li Dan's sister Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi launched a coup which resulted in the death of Empress Wei. Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song then persuaded Li Dan to take the throne himself, and he agreed, returning to the throne in Emperor Shang's stead. Li Longji, although not the oldest son, was made crown prince on account of his accomplishments. Soon, however, tensions between Princess Taiping, who had many supporters, and Li Longji mounted. Eventually, in September 712, Emperor Ruizong, believing that astrological signs called for a change of emperors, abdicated in favor of Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong, now carrying the title of ""Taishang Huang"" (retired emperor), continued to wield actual power. However, in 713, suspecting Princess Taiping of planning a coup, Emperor Xuanzong acted first, killing her associates and forcing her to commit suicide. After the death of Princess Taiping, Emperor Ruizong himself yielded imperial powers to Emperor Xuanzong and left the governmental scene. He died in 716.

In December 1308, he was appointed Archbishop of Lyon and Primate of Gaul. Unlike his predecessor, Peter of Savoy does not accept the gradual takeover of the kingdom of France in Lyon. It therefore encourages residents to révolt, encourages them to strengthen the city walls, and he puts aside the historical dispute between the archbishop and cathédral chapter, providing a pretext for Philip the Fair to send his son Louis, King of Navarre and his brother Charles of Valois to lead an army besieging Lyon in 1310. The war ended with the intervention of the Archbishop's uncle, Amédée V of Savoie, who reluctantly agreed with the king's side not to be the next victim. A treaty was signed on 10 April 1312. But Peter losses control of Lyon to the King. The people of Lyon receive several franchises, such as the right to establish fees for the service of the city. These are the subject of two written papers, one by clerics Lyon between the opening of the Council of Vienna on 16 October 1311 and the Treaty of 10 April 1312, appointed Grauamina, the other by the prosecutor of the bailiff Macon, between this treaty and the end of 1312.

Of this, the royal treasury will not give in that 2000 livres, which the king added, by ""royal munificence"" (sua munificentia regalis) 500 Other livres.

Johann Ludwig Knoop (15 May 1821 in Bremen - 14 August 1894 in Bremen) was a cotton merchant and entrepreneur from the city-state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, who became one of the richest entrepreneurs in his time. He was created a Baron by Alexander II of Russia. He studied in Bremen, and learned the cotton business at Manchester with the Bremen-born cotton exporter Johan Frerichs's company De Jersey & Co. He went to Moscow as assistant to the firm's agent Franz Holzhauer in 1840. That year he established the first power-driven cotton mill in Russia. In 1842, the British ban on the export of cotton machinery, imposed in 1775 to protect the country's head start in technology, was lifted, allowing the manufacture of cotton to expand in Russia. Knoop used English credit to build and fit out mills with English equipment. The commissioning in 1847 of Morozov's Nikolsk mill at Orekhovo-Zuyevo, Knoop's sixth, was seen as a landmark in the industry's development in Russia. In 1852, he founded L Knoop & Co, in association with De Jersey and the machinery manufacturer Platt Brothers of Oldham, Lancashire. In 1857, he built the largest cotton spinning mill in Europe on the island of Kreenholm at Narva, Estonia, which employed 4500 people. The Krenholm Manufacturing Company's factory in Narva had nearly half a million spindles driven by water-power. It paid low wages, but took its responsibilities to its workforce seriously, introducing a health insurance scheme and supplying workers with dwellings, kindergartens, and schools. Eventually, he was responsible for equipping 187 cotton mills on Russian territory. However, Knoop came under attack from the Russian Technical Society for retarding industrial development in the country. This was because he relied exclusively on English machinery and also supplied the factories with English managers, technicians, and supervisors. He was created a baron by Tsar Alexander II in 1877. He died on 16 August 1894 at St Magnus, Bremen, where a city park created from his estate is named after him. His descendants include Ernst Albrecht, Hans-Holger Albrecht and Ursula von der Leyen.
