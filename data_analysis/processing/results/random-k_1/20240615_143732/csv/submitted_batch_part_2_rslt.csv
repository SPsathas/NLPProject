Antonia Malatesta of Cesena, also known as Antonia Malatesta of Rimini, was the daughter (or possibly the niece) of Carlo I Malatesta, Lord of Cesena, Fano, Pesaro, and Rimini. To help ally himself with the House of Malatesta, Giovanni Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan married Antonia in the city of Brescia in 1408. They had no issue. After Giovanni Maria’s assassination in 1412, the succeeding Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, permitted Antonia to continue sharing the governance of the duchy for a few months. Although she soon retired to Cesena, she retained her title, Duchess of Milan.

Die Stadt ohne Juden (""The City Without Jews"") is a 1924 Austrian Expressionist film by Hans Karl Breslauer, based on the book of the same title by Hugo Bettauer. The film is one of the few surviving Expressionist films from Austria and has therefore been well researched. The film was first shown on 25 July 1924 in Vienna. In his novel, published in 1922, Hugo Bettauer succeeded in creating a relatively accurate allegorical vision of the near future, although the book was intended as entertainment and as a satirical response to the primitive antisemitism of the 1920s. It immediately became Bettauer's most popular work: it was translated into several languages, and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Shortly after the premiere of the film Hugo Bettauer was murdered by Otto Rothstock, a former member of the Nazi Party, who was lionized by the antisemitic Austrian masses and was released less than two years after having been committed to a psychiatric institution.

ad43c9300bdb11eba7f7acde48001122,Tantallon Castle.,Tantallon Castle,"Out of the Inkwell
Out of the Inkwell was a major animated series of the silent era produced by Max Fleischer from 1918 to 1929. The series was the result of three short experimental films that Max Fleischer independently produced in the period of 1914 – 1916 to demonstrate his invention, the Rotoscope, which was a device consisting of a film projector and easel used as an aid for achieving realistic movement for animated cartoons. The Rotoscope would project motion picture film through an opening in the easel, covered by a glass pane serving as a drawing surface. The image on the projected film was traced onto paper, advancing the film one frame at a time as each drawing would be made. Fleischer's younger brother Dave Fleischer, who was working as a clown at Coney Island, served as the model for their first famous character, eventually known as"" Koko the Clown."" "" Out of the Inkwell"" began at the Bray Studio as a monthly entry in"" The Bray Pictorgraph Screen Magazine"" produced for Paramount from 1918, and later for Goldwyn from 1920 to 1921. In that same year, The Fleischer brothers started their own studio, and in 1923, the clown who previously had no name came to be known as KO- KO when animation veteran Dick Huemer became the new Director of Animation. Huemer, who began his animation career with the"" Mutt and Jeff"" cartoons in 1916, brought the influence of the short and tall companions to"" Out of the Inkwell"" with the creation of a small canine companion named Fitz, who would later evolve into Bimbo in the sound era. Huemer redesigned the clown for animation, which reduced the Fleischer's dependency on the Rotoscope for fluid animation. He also defined the drawing style with his distinctive inking quality that the series was famous for. But it was the interaction of the live action sequences with the artist/ creator, Max Fleischer and his pen and ink creations that was the foundation of the series. Typically, the cartoons start out with live action showing Max drawing the characters on paper, or opening the inkwell to release the characters into"" reality."" The"" Out of the Inkwell"" series ran from 1918 to mid 1927, and was renamed"" The Inkwell Imps"" for Paramount, continuing until 1929. In all, 62"" Out of the Inkwell"" and 56"" Inkwell Imps"" films were produced within 11 years. "" The Inkwell Imps"" series was replaced by the"" Talkartoons"" in 1929, and Koko was retired until 1931, appearing as a supporting character with Bimbo and Betty Boop. Koko's last theatrical appearance was in the Betty Boop cartoon,"" Ha- Ha- Ha""( 1934), which was a remake of the silent"" Out of the Inkwell"" film,"" The Cure""( 1924). Koko had a brief cameo in his only color theatrical appearance in the"" Screen Song"" entry,"" Toys will be Toys""( 1949). In 1950, Stuart Productions released a number of the Inkwell Studios"" Out of the Inkwell"" cartoons, and a selection of the Paramount"" Inkwell Imps"" cartoons to television. In 1955, the"" Inkwell Imps"", along with 2,500 pre-October 1950 Paramount shorts and cartoons were sold to television packagers, the majority acquired by U.M.& M. TV Corporation. In 1958, Max Fleischer reactivated his studio in a partnership with Hal Seeger, and in 1960 produced a series of 100"" Out Of The Inkwell"" five- minute cartoons. In the new color series, KoKo had a clown girlfriend named KoKette, a pal named Kokonut and a villain named Mean Moe. Larry Storch provided the voice for KoKo and all of the supporting characters.

Henry Andrew Pogorzelski (September 26, 1922 - December 30, 2015) was an American mathematician of Polish descent, a professor of Mathematics at the University of Maine. Much of Pogorzelski's research concerns the Goldbach conjecture, the still-unsolved problem of whether every even number can be represented as a sum of two prime numbers. Born in Harrison, New Jersey, Pogorzelski served in the U.S. Army in World War II. He served as editor of ""Mathematical Reviews"" from 1957 to 1964 and studied at the Institute for Advanced Study under André Weil. He received his Ph.D. from CUNY in 1969 under the advisor Raymond Smullyan; his dissertation was on ""Goldbach Sentences in Some Abstract Arithmetics Constructed from a Generalization of Ordinary Recursive Arithmetic"". In 1974, after he had joined the Maine faculty, he was the only American invited by the Polish Academy of Science to visit Poland for the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the birth of Copernicus. In 2002, the University of Maine attempted to suspend Pogorzelski from teaching duties, but backed down after he filed an age discrimination complaint. As well as holding a faculty position at the University of Maine, Pogorzelski was the director of the Research Institute for Mathematics (formerly known as the Research Institute for Semiological Mathematics), an independent research institute located near the University of Maine in Orono, Maine and modeled after the Institute for Advanced Study. He proposed in 1993 to offer doctorates through the institute; the proposal was rejected at the time, but the Research Institute for Mathematics is now the only institution in Maine that grants doctoral degrees in mathematics. Henry Pogorzelski died December 30, 2015 in Orono, Maine.

There was much evidence of official conciliation toward Islam in Russia in the 1990s. The number of Muslims allowed to make pilgrimages to Mecca increased sharply after the embargo of the Soviet era ended in 1991. In 1995 the newly established Union of Muslims of Russia, led by Imam Khatyb Mukaddas of Tatarstan, began organizing a movement aimed at improving inter-ethnic understanding and ending Russians' lingering misconception of Islam.

The lynching of Emmett Till and the visceral response to his mother's decision to have an open - casket funeral mobilized the African - American community nationwide. Forms of protest and / or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955 -- 56) in Alabama; ``sit - ins ''such as the influential Greensboro sit - ins (1960) in North Carolina and successful Nashville sit - ins in Tennessee; marches, such as the Birmingham Children's Crusade and Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.

8ba63ce8098f11ebbdb0ac1f6bf848b6,Yes.,yes,"Daniel Santbech
Daniel Santbech( fl. 1561) was a Dutch mathematician and astronomer. He adopted the Latinized name of Noviomagus, possibly suggesting that he came from the town of Nijmegen, called"" Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum"" by the Romans. In 1561, Santbech compiled a collected edition of the works of Regiomontanus( 1436 – 1476),"" De triangulis planis et sphaericis libri quinque""( first published in 1533) and"" Compositio tabularum sinum recto"", as well as Santbech's own"" Problematum astronomicorum et geometricorum sectiones septem"". It was published in Basel by Henrich Petri and Petrus Perna. Santbech's work consisted of studies on astronomy, sundials, surveying, and levelling for water courses. It also includes descriptions of astronomical instruments, information for navigators and geographers, and general information about astronomy in the first years after Nicolaus Copernicus. Santbech also studied the subject of gunnery and ballistics as a theoretic discourse as well as for the practical application of war, and utilized the foundations of geometry, with ample references to Euclid and Ptolemy, in order to do so. Santbech seem not to have been aware of similar studies by Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia. Santbech's text included theoretical illustrations of trajectories. These were depicted with abruptly acute angles and straight lines, allowing him to create a right- angled triangle from which ranges were computed with the help of a table of sines. Santbech was of course fully aware that a cannonball's true trajectory would not consist of a straight line and a sudden drop, but these depictions were meant to assist with mathematical calculations. In 1651, Riccioli gave Santbech's name to the crater Santbech on the Moon.
