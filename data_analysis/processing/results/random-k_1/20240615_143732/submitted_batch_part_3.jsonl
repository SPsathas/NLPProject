Stevens was recovering during what amounted to nearly a year of convalescence, after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung and tuberculosis. He spent three months in King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, England, transferring afterward to another nine months of bedrest at home. Stevens, who was near death at the time he was admitted in the hospital, used the time he was recuperating for contemplation, and wrote dozens of songs, including\" Trouble\", many of which were recorded much later. When he was hospitalized, Stevens was often alone in a very spare and plain room. He was told that at the time he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him. The effect on the 19- year- old pop star was pronounced. He said,\" To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut.\" The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folk- rock emphasis. While recovering, Stevens donated his spare time, and some of his newer, more introspective songs for Colin Higgins and Hal Ashby's 1971 film soundtrack of\" Harold and Maude\". Most of the tunes used for the movie appear on Stevens's next albums,\" Mona Bone Jakon\" and\" Tea for the Tillerman\", with the exception of two songs which were not released until the release of the album in 1984,\" If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" and\" Do n't Be Shy\". In\" Harold and Maude\" the song\" Trouble\" is used in the scene of Maude's impending death, with her devoted young lover heartbroken over the turn of events.\n\nWhich film has the director who died earlier, 11 Harrowhouse or A Little Sister Of Everybody?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Social systems such as religion, language and ethnic traditions can have a powerful impact on realization of sexual orientation. Influences of culture may complicate the process of measuring sexual orientation. The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-class, well-educated samples, however there are pockets of research that document various other cultural groups, although these are frequently limited in diversity of gender and sexual orientation of the subjects. Integration of sexual orientation with sociocultural identity may be a challenge for LGBT individuals. Individuals may or may not consider their sexual orientation to define their sexual identity, as they may experience various degrees of fluidity of sexuality, or may simply identify more strongly with another aspect of their identity such as family role. American culture puts a great emphasis on individual attributes, and views the self as unchangeable and constant. In contrast, East Asian cultures put a great emphasis on a person's social role within social hierarchies, and view the self as fluid and malleable. These differing cultural perspectives have many implications on cognitions of the self, including perception of sexual orientation.\n\nWhich film was released earlier, New Jersey Drive or It Happened At The World'S Fair?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy.\n\nWhere does Chris Warren (Rugby League)'s father work at?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Quintanilla III, and produced by Quintanilla, and is a Spanish-language adaptation of \" Is It the Beat?\", an English song originally written by Quintanilla and Pamela Phillips Oland. \"Enamorada de Ti\" is a freestyle song, a musical genre popular during the late 1980s. The recording was remixed by Juan Magan for the eponymous album in 2012, a project headed by Humberto Gatica. Although the song was moderately successful during the early 1990s, it was exposed to a wider audience in the remix album \"Enamorada de Ti\". Because of this, the song peaked at number 17 on the US \"Billboard\" Regional Mexican Digital Songs chart that year. In 1997, the posthumously-released remix version of \"Is It the Beat?\" adopted the rap verse found in \"Enamorada de Ti\". In the lyrics the protagonist sings to her love interest about his departure, which has saddened her; without him she cannot function normally, because she is in love with him. Selena performed the song during her Ven Conmigo Tour (1990\u201392) and at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards, where she received the Female Vocalist of the Year award. During the first season of Telemundo's \"La Voz Kids\", a Spanish-language version of the US singing competition \"The Voice\", Xairexis Garcia performed \"Enamorada de Ti\".\n\nWhich film has the director born later, Under The Lantern or Darling Of The Gods?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}
