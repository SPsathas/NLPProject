In 1978, she formed Holly and the Italians and moved to London, England, where the band was welcomed by the British press and gained a recording contract with Virgin Records on the strength of the single\" Tell That Girl to Shut Up\". Holly and the Italians' debut album\" The Right to Be Italian\" had a troubled and long production and was a commercial failure, which led to the band's dissolution at the end of 1980, after a US tour supporting The Clash and the Ramones. Vincent recorded under her name the album\" Holly and the Italians\" in the UK and was then deported to the US by the British authorities. She went to live in New York City, where she was a member of The Waitresses for a short time and played in other local groups. In 1990, she moved to Los Angeles and two years later recorded the album\" America\" with a new band that she had formed called The Oblivious. The album\" Vowel Movement\" followed in 1994, as a collaboration with Concrete Blonde singer Johnette Napolitano.

He usually combined ballads with classical music and was deeply involved in Puerto Rican folk elements and even Andalusian music, as to produce many memorable Latino pop songs which featured elaborate, dramatic lyrics. F\u00e9lix Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Cap\u00f3 was born in Coamo, Puerto Rico to Celso Quiterio Rodr\u00edguez Rivera and Arsenia Cap\u00f3 Canevaro. He adopted \"Bobby\" as his first name and, as Rodr\u00edguez is a common Hispanic surname, he reportedly opted to use his mother's less common one, Cap\u00f3, instead. He then migrated to New York City early in the 1940s. Initially, he replaced Pedro Ortiz D\u00e1vila, \"Davilita\", in a quartet, the Cuarteto Victoria of Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn. He then joined Xavier Cugat's orchestra. Apart from singing, he was also a television host, as well as technical and musical director, and prolific songwriter. He wrote songs for many of his contemporaries. Many of these became hits in Puerto Rico, and occasionally in the rest of Latin America. One of his self-penned songs was \"El Negro Bemb\u00f3n\", a hit for Cortijo y su Combo in the mid-1950s. The song, with local circumstances and character name changed, became \"El Gitano Ant\u00f3n\", a huge hit for Catalan rumba singer Peret in Spain around the mid-1960s. Also, Bobby Capo wrote the score and songs for the movie \"MARUJA\" that was filmed at the end of the 1950s in Puerto Rico. Cap\u00f3's \"Sin FeWithout Faith\"), sometimes known as \"Poquita FeLittle Faith\"), became a proper hit in Puerto Rico when recorded by Felipe Rodr\u00edguez in the mid-1950s, and a huge international hit for Jos\u00e9 Feliciano in the mid-1960s. Cap\u00f3's composition describing his homesickness for Puerto Rico, \"So\u00f1ando con Puerto RicoDreaming of Puerto Rico\"), is revered as an anthem by Puerto Ricans residing abroad. Another of his songs, \"De Las Monta\u00f1as Venimos\" is a Christmas standard in Puerto Rico. His best-known song is \"Piel Canela\" (whose title literally translates to \"Cinnamon Skin\"). He wrote and recorded an English-language version, \"You, Too\", which he most notably recorded in Havana at the request of Rogelio Mart\u00ednez of Sonora Matancera, who asked him to sing pieces of his recently composed songs with his band. Josephine Baker recorded a version in French. The song became the main theme for a Mexican movie of the same name in the late 1950s. So was \"Luna de Miel en Puerto RicoPuerto Rican Honeymoon\"), a latter-day chachach\u00e1 which was the theme for an eponymous movie, co-produced by Mexicans and Puerto Ricans in the early 1960s.\n\nWhere was the director of film Medal Of Honor (Film) born?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

In addition, he said in an interview, that gay porn movies were\" so bad\" that he decided to begin making them himself. In 1978, he was busted and his premises raided.

After rejecting Australia and Thailand as new venues, he settled in Amsterdam, where his distributor was, and later relocated to Prague, a less expensive city. Although the legal climate in the U.S. has changed, he had no interest in returning. His first film,\" A Married Man\", was produced in 1974.

Mickey is on exhibition at a 400 m2 habitat and as of June 2009, was two years old and weighed 180 kg (400 lb). Attempts to verify this report have been bolstered by recent images purported to show the adult Mickey (see External links section). There has been no report of the birth of a healthy hybrid from a male jaguar and female tiger, which would be termed a \"jagger\".There is a claimed sighting of a lion \u00d7 black jaguar cross (male) and a tiger \u00d7 black jaguar cross (female) loose in Maui, Hawaii. There are no authenticated tiger/jaguar hybrids and the description matches that of a liger. The alleged tiger \u00d7 black jaguar was large, relatively long necked (probably due to lack of a ruff or mane) with both stripes and \"jaguar-like\" rosettes on its sides. The assertion of hybrid identity was due to the combination of black, dark brown, light brown, dark orange, dark yellow and beige markings and the tiger-like stripes radiating from its face. It is more likely to have been a released liger since these are very large and have a mix of rosettes (lion juvenile markings) and stripes and can have a brindled mix of colours exactly as described (their markings are extremely variable).\n\nWhich film has the director who died later, Akhono Onek Raat or Bitter Rice?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He was the son of the fourteenth Sultan, Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah and the legitimate heir to the throne of Terengganu. Sultan Sulaiman died on 25 September 1942 of blood poisoning. The Japanese Military Administration, which at that time occupied Malaya, proclaimed Sultan Ali as the Sultan of Terengganu. On 18 October 1943, the Thai government under Prime Minister Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram took over the administration of Terengganu from the Japanese and continued to recognise Sultan Ali as the legitimate Sultan. When the British returned after the end of World War II, they declined to recognise Sultan Ali. Allegedly, Sultan Ali was too much in debt and had been too close to the Japanese during their occupation. According to Sultan Ali, the British Military Administration wanted him removed for his refusal to sign the Malayan Union treaty. The British Military Administration also disapproved of Sultan Ali's character, where he was said to have repudiated his official consort Tengku Putri Hajjah \u2018 Ain ul- Jamal,\" Tengku Sri Nila Utama\" of Pahang( the daughter of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang) and had contracted an unsuitable second marriage to a former prostitute. On 5 November 1945 the Terengganu State Council of thirteen members announced the dismissal of Sultan Ali and the appointment of Tengku Ismail as the sixteenth Sultan of Terengganu. Tengku Ismail became known as Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah and was installed on 6 June 1949 at Istana Maziah, Kuala Terengganu. Sultan Ismail's descendants have since ruled Terengganu.
