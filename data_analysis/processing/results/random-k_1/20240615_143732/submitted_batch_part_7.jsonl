The story of the Bull of Heaven has two different versions: one recorded in an earlier Sumerian poem and a later version in the standard Akkadian\" Epic of Gilgamesh\". In the Sumerian poem, the Bull is sent to attack Gilgamesh by the goddess Inanna for reasons that are unclear. The more complete Akkadian account comes from Tablet VI of the\" Epic of Gilgamesh\", in which Gilgamesh rejects the sexual advances of the goddess Ishtar, the East Semitic equivalent of Inanna, leading the enraged Ishtar to demand her father Anu for the Bull of Heaven, so that she may send it to attack Gilgamesh in Uruk. Anu gives her the Bull and she sends it to attack Gilgamesh and his companion, the hero Enkidu, who slay the Bull together. After defeating the Bull, Enkidu hurls the Bull's right thigh at Ishtar, taunting her. The slaying of the Bull results in the gods condemning Enkidu to death, an event which catalyzes Gilgamesh's fear for his own death, which drives the remaining portion of the epic. The Bull was identified with the constellation Taurus and the myth of its slaying may have held astronomical significance to the ancient Mesopotamians. Aspects of the story have been compared to later tales from the ancient Near East, including legends from Ugarit, the tale of Joseph in the Book of Genesis, and parts of the ancient Greek epics, the\" Iliad\" and the\" Odyssey\".\n\nWhich film has the director died first, To Mary \u2013 With Love or Five Little Peppers And How They Grew?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He is an early pioneer of independent cinema. Soderbergh's directorial breakthrough\u2014indie drama \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (1989)\u2014lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry. At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival which garnered the film worldwide commercial success, among numerous accolades. His breakthrough saw him to Hollywood where he directed crime comedy \"Out of Sight\" (1998); biopic \"Erin Brockovich\" (2000) and crime drama film \"Traffic\" (2000), the latter winning him the Academy Award for Best Director. He found further popular and critical success with the \"Ocean's\" trilogy and film franchise (2001\u201318); \"Contagion\" (2011); \"Magic Mike\" (2012); \"Side Effects\" (2013); \"Logan Lucky\" (2017); and \"Unsane\" (2018). Despite his film career spanning a multitude of genres, his cinematic niche centers on psychological, crime, and heist thrillers. His films have grossed over US$2.2 billion worldwide and garnered nine Oscar nominations, winning seven. Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts often used for big budget Hollywood movies but with an avant garde arthouse approach to them. They center on the themes of shifting personal identities, vengeance, sexuality, morality, and the human condition. His feature films retain distinctive cinematography as a result of his liberal use of avant-garde cinema coupled with unconventional film and camera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines with plot twists, nonlinear storytelling, experimental sequencing, suspenseful soundscapes, and third person vantage points. Uniquely, he often serves as his own director of photography and editor under the respective pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard.\n\nWho is the paternal grandmother of Renaud Iii, Count Of Soissons?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

It also served as an effective link between the growing parts of the French empire. The navy performed well during World War I, in which it mainly protected the naval lanes in the Mediterranean Sea. At the onset of the war, the French -- with 16 battleships, 6 cruisers, and 24 destroyers -- had the largest fleet in the Mediterranean. French defeats in the early stages of World War II, however, forced the British to destroy the French navy at Mers - el - Kebir in order to prevent its fall to the Germans. Currently, French naval doctrine calls for two aircraft carriers, but the French currently only have one, the Charles de Gaulle, due to restructuring.

Herbert was born in Brisbane, to botanist Desmond Herbert and his wife, Vera Prowse (the daughter of John Henry Prowse, a federal politician from Western Australia). His sister Joan would also become a botanist like their father. In 1943, Herbert enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy where he served in the Indian Ocean, Burma, New Guinea, and the Admiralty Islands until his discharge from the naval base in March 1946. He then worked as a bank clerk for the English, Scottish and Australian Bank (ES&A), and was involved in the anti-bank nationalisation campaign of 1947. He was a member of the Liberal Party, and was a member of the party's state executive from 1950 until 1956 when he successfully ran for election in the electoral district of Sherwood. He served in various ministerial positions from 1965 to 1978, holding the portfolios of labour, tourism, sport and welfare services. Herbert resigned due to ill health in September 1978, and died several weeks later at Hopetoun Private Hospital on 30 October. A state funeral was held for him on 2 November, with the Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, as one of his pall bearers. The John Herbert Memorial Award, part of the Queensland Heritage Awards, is granted each year for the state's most outstanding heritage project. Prior to 2004, the Queensland Heritage Awards themselves had been known as the John Herbert Memorial Awards. A 1946 extension of the Sherwood Arboretum was later renamed the John Herbert Memorial Vista in his honour, and is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register along with the main site. John Herbert was also patron of the Oxley Golf Club and Jindalee Golf Club, both of which were located in his electorate.
