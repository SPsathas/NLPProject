She was one of Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine, often known as Mei fei (with \"fei\" being a standard rank for imperial consorts during her lifetime). Her actual name was Jiang Caipin (\"\u6c5f\u91c7\u860b\"), originally called Consort Jiang. After being told by her that she greatly favored Plum-Blossom flowers (the flower is pronounced as \"mei\" in Chinese), Emperor Xuanzong began to fondly address her as Consort Mei. Consort Mei was initially selected by Gao Lishi, a eunuch official of Emperor Xuanzong, to become one of Emperor Xuanzong's concubines in his harem. As Consort Mei was the most literate and talented concubines, she soon obtained Xuanzong's favors. To express the favors towards Consort Mei, Xuanzong commanded servants to plant Plum-Blossom trees all around her palace to please her interest. Xuanzong even lovingly complimented her beauty as more adorable than Zhao Feiyan, and swore that he would never change his heart for her. However, in 737, after the death of Consort Wu, another favorite concubine of Xuanzong, Xuanzong was deeply depressed until Gao Lishi convinced him to try looking at Yang Yuhuan - the wife of prince Li Mao, Xuanzong son with Consort Wu since her beauty was described as the most \"irresistible\". Being curious, Xuanzong ordered Yang Yuhuan to come and subsequently fell in love with her beauty. Since Yuhuan was still literally his daughter-in-law (as she was Li Mao's wife), emperor Xuanzong then stealthily arranged Yuhuan to become a Taoist nun, after a brief moment, Xuanzong eventually offered Yuhuan honorable title as Yang Guifei (with \"Guifei\" being the highest rank for imperial consorts) after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife. Yuhuan became Xuanzong's most beloved consort as Xuanzong soon forgot about Consort Wu's death. His favors towards Consort Mei also waned. In 755, An Lushan began to create a rebellion (known as An Lushan Rebellion) in the palace. Emperor Xuanzong decided to bring Yang Guifei and his cortege along to flee from the capital Chang'an to Chengdu.

The film is based on the 2006 graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. The plot revolves around an amnesiac outlaw( Craig), a wealthy cattleman( Ford), and a mysterious traveler( Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople abducted by aliens. The screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, based on a screen story by the latter two along with Steve Oedekerk. The film was produced by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with Steven Spielberg and Favreau serving as executive producers. The project began development in April 1997, when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures bought film rights to a concept pitched by Rosenberg, former president at Malibu Comics, which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of$ 163 million, filming for\" Cowboys& Aliens\" began in June 2010, in New Mexico and California. Despite studio pressure to release the film in 3- D, Favreau chose to film traditionally and in anamorphic format( widescreen picture on standard 35 mm film) to further a\" classic movie feel\". Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's\" inherently comic\" title and premise. The film's aliens were designed to be\" cool and captivating\", with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place. \" Cowboys& Aliens\" premiered at the 2011 San Diego Comic- Con and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on, 2011. The film was considered to be a financial disappointment, taking$ 174.8 million in box office receipts on a$ 163 million budget. \" Cowboys& Aliens\" received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting while criticizing other aspects.\n\nWho is the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}
