Supplied by the Soviet Union, from late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov -- Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz bombing campaign, and the Balkan Campaign, as well as the long - running Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history, which trapped the major part of the Axis military forces into a war of attrition. In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States and European colonies in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific.\n\nWhich film has the director who died later, The Mystic Masseur or Butter Fingers?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He was the elder son of Henry Somerset, 2nd Duke of Beaufort and his second wife, Rachel Noel. As his father's eldest son and heir to his father's title he was known as (styled) Marquess of Worcester, a courtesy title. On his father's death on 24 April 1714 he succeeded him and became 3rd Duke of Beaufort. At the age of 19 he commissioned the construction of what would later become known as the Badminton Chest or Badminton Cabinet, an ornate set of drawers made in Florence. The chest was sold in 2004 to Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein for \u00a319 million, making it the most expensive piece of furniture in the world. It is on display in the Palais Liechtenstein in Vienna, Austria. On 28 June 1729 he married Frances Scudamore (14 August 1711 \u2013 16 February 1750), the only daughter and heir of James Scudamore, 3rd Viscount Scudamore, and took his wife's name by an Act of Parliament later the same year. In 1742 he filed for divorce due to Frances' adulterous relationship with William Talbot, who later became Earl Talbot. Frances countersued, saying the Duke was impotent; in March 1743, he demonstrated before court-appointed examiners that he was physically able to have an erection. The divorce was granted, and he sued Talbot for damages. Frances later remarried to Charles FitzRoy-Scudamore. The Duke was one of several founding governors of Britain's first institution for abandoned children, the Foundling Hospital, and his name is listed in its royal charter received from George II in October 1739. After his death, the 3rd Duke of Beaufort was buried at St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton. Because he had no legitimate children, his titles and estates were inherited by his younger brother, Charles Noel Somerset.

Fackenthal\nFrank Diehl Fackenthal( February 22, 1883 \u2013 September 5, 1968) was an American academic administrator best known for his long association with Columbia University. He was of Pennsylvania Dutch descent and resided for much of his life in Brooklyn, New York. A self- described\" able C man\", Fackenthal graduated from Boys High School in 1902 before earning his undergraduate degree from Columbia College in 1906. As a student, his prodigious administrative abilities( reflected by his leadership in various campus organizations, including the Varsity Show and the\" Columbia Daily Spectator\") were recognized by president Nicholas Murray Butler, leading to his career as chief clerk( 1906 \u2013 1910), secretary( 1910 \u2013 1937), and provost( 1937 \u2013 1948) of the University. As secretary and provost, he was the\" de facto\" administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes from their inception until 1948; following his retirement, he received a special Prize in recognition of his service. Previously, Fackenthal received an honorary LL.D. from Franklin& Marshall College( a recipient of familial philanthropy) and an honorary Litt.D. from Columbia in 1929. Although he never completed an earned graduate degree, he was frequently characterized in the press thereafter as\" Dr. Fackenthal.\" He later received honorary doctorates from Syracuse University, Rutgers University, New York University and Union College. Between the retirement of Nicholas Murray Butler in 1945 and the installation of Dwight D. Eisenhower as president in 1948, Fackenthal served as acting president while retaining his post as provost. Although several trustees considered motioning for his permanent appointment, this was forestalled by the ailing Butler, who considered Fackenthal( whom he publicly deprecated as\" my clerk\") to be unworthy of the position. Despite this acrimony, Fackenthal was elected to the university's board of trustees against Butler's wishes in 1946 in an unprecedented breach of longstanding tradition. As acting president, Fackenthal developed a plan for Columbia's continued growth that was\" largely eschewed by his successors\", presaging the tumult of Grayson Kirk's administration and the Columbia University protests of 1968. He also oversaw the formation of the School of General Studies( for nontraditional undergraduates and nonmatriculated students), the graduate- level School of International Affairs and the Harriman Institute. Following his retirement from the University in 1948, he served as educational consultant to the Carnegie Corporation( 1948 \u2013 1952) and then as president of Columbia University Press( 1953 \u2013 1958). He also served as president of the Bushwick Savings Bank and remained a trustee of various institutions, including Columbia, Barnard College, Franklin and Marshall College and the Riverdale Country School. His principal speeches as acting president were published by Columbia University Press as\" The Greater Power and Other Addresses\"( 1949). In December 1965, he was critically injured when his car collided with a truck in White Township, New Jersey, 35 miles south of his country home in Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania. As a result of his injuries, Fackenthal( who never married and had no legitimate children) was forced to permanently relocate from Brooklyn to Buck Hill Falls. He relinquished his trusteeship of Columbia in 1967 and died at Monroe County General Hospital in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, on September 5, 1968.\n\nWhich film has the director born later, Gene Autry And The Mounties or Sunday'S Illness?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.\n\nWhich film has the director born later, La Soif De L'Or or Forelsket I K\u00f8benhavn?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}
