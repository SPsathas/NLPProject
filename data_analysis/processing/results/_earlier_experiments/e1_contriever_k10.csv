Begun after the success of Lynch's 1977 film"" EraserheadRonnie Rocket"" was shelved after Lynch felt he would be unable to find financial backing for the project.

"" Ronnie Rocket"" was to feature many of the elements which have since come to be seen as Lynch's hallmarks; including industrial art direction, 1950s popular culture and physical deformity. The script featured a three- foot tall man with control over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J.

Guardians of the Galaxy (film)
Bradley Cooper as Rocket: A genetically engineered raccoon - like bounty hunter and mercenary who is a master of weapons and battle tactics. Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was ``not a cartoon character '', saying,`` It's not Bugs Bunny in the middle of the Avengers, it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean - ass fighting machine.'' Gunn also based the character on himself. Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, ``I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas guy. ''Cooper voiced Rocket, while Sean Gunn (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming. James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators, though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film. Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance`` the fast - talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket.''

"Antiochus (son of Antiochus III the Great)
Antiochus( 221 BC – 193 BC) was a Seleucid prince, first- born child to the Seleucid monarchs Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III, and his father's first heir.

Laodice of the Sameans
Laodice was a Queen of an unknown Kingdom in Asia. She lived at the time of the Seleucid king of Syria Antiochus X Eusebes who reigned 95 BC- 92 or 88 BC.

Laodice (wife of Mithridates III of Pontus)
Laodice (fl. late 3rd – early 2nd centuries BCE) was a Greek Princess from the Seleucid Empire and the wife of King Mithridates III of Pontus. Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice and Laodice VI. Laodice bore Mithridates III three children: Mithridates IV of Pontus, Pharnaces I of Pontus and Laodice.

Antiochus IX Cyzicenus
Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus (""Antiochus the Pious, the Cyzicene"") was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom. He was the son of Antiochus VII Sidetes and Cleopatra Thea. He left the kingdom in 129 BC and went to the city of Cyzicus, but he returned in 116 BC to challenge his half-brother Antiochus VIII for power. The siblings fought a twenty-year civil war. In 112 BC, Antiochus IX's wife, Cleopatra IV, was killed by her sister Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus VIII. Tryphaena herself died shortly afterwards. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; he was succeeded by his sons Seleucus VI and Demetrius III. Antiochus IX then took the capital Antioch and married his deceased wife's sister Cleopatra Selene, who was herself the widow of Antiochus VIII. Seleucus VI continued the war against his uncle. Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus was killed in battle in 96 BC.

Antiochus VII Sidetes
Antiochus VII Euergetes (c.164/160 BC - 129 BC) , nicknamed Sidetes  (from Side, a city in Asia Minor), also known as Antiochus the Pious, was ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from July/August 138 to 129 BC. He was the last Seleucid king of any stature. After Antiochus was killed in battle, the Seleucid realm was restricted to Syria.

Antiochus Hierax
Antiochus (killed c. 226 BC), called Hierax (Ἱέραξ, ""Hawk"") for his grasping and ambitious character, was the younger son of Antiochus II and Laodice I and separatist leader in the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom, who ruled as king of Syria during his brother's reign.

Antiochus VIII Grypus
Antiochus VIII Epiphanes/Callinicus/Philometor, nicknamed Grypus (""hook-nose""), was the ruler of the Syrian Seleucid Empire from 125 to 96 BC. He was the younger son of Demetrius II and Cleopatra Thea. He may have spent his early life in Athens and returned to Syria after the deaths of his father and brother Seleucus V. At first he was joint ruler with his mother. Fearing her influence, Antiochus VIII had Cleopatra Thea poisoned in 121 BC. Political instability affected most of Antiochus VIII's reign. From 116 BC he fought a civil war against his half-brother Antiochus IX. Antiochus VIII's wife, the Ptolemaic Egyptian princess Tryphaena, had her sister and the wife of Antiochus IX, the former Cleopatra IV of Egypt, murdered in 112 BC; Antiochus IX killed Tryphaena in revenge. In 102 BC, Antiochus VIII's aunt Cleopatra III of Egypt, the mother of the two rival queens, gave him the hand of her daughter Cleopatra Selene in marriage. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC.

Antiochus VI Dionysus
Antiochus VI Dionysus (c. 148–142/1 BC), king of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom, was the son of Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea, daughter of Ptolemy VI of Egypt.

Laodice I
Laodice I (flourished 3rd century BC, died before 236 BC) was a Greek noblewoman of Anatolia who was a close relative of the early Seleucid dynasty and was the first wife of the Seleucid Greek King Antiochus II Theos.

La muerte de un burócrata
La muerte de un burócrata (Death of a Bureaucrat) is a 1966 comedy film by Cuban director Tomás Gutiérrez Alea which pokes fun at the Communist bureaucracy and red tape and how it affects the lives of the common people who have to waste time and overcome hurdles just to get on with their ordinary lives. The story begins with the death of a model worker, who is buried with his labor card as a badge of honor. However, his widow is told she needs that card to claim the benefits she is entitled to. The story then takes several surreal turns, as the family of the dead man tries to recover the precious card from the grave. As they succeed to do so, the bureaucracy grows into a formidable enemy: Their wish to re-bury the husband is turned down, because all the official documents show he already has been buried...

Fleetwood Sheppard
Fleetwood Sheppard (sometimes spelled as ""Shepphard,Sheppheard,"" and ""Sheppeard"") (1 January 1634 – 25 August 1698) was a British courtier and literary wit who was instrumental in the courts of Charles II of England and William of Orange. He was an educated man known for his lively wit and honesty, and he was an important figure in the poetry of the 1680s and 1690s. He was born in Oxfordshire, attended Magdalen Hall and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining the Bachelor of Arts in 1654 and Master of Arts in 1657. When all persons attaining an M.A. were required to join the Church of England, King Charles intervened and said that Sheppard had a background in civil law (having studied at Gray's Inn) and was ""not prepared to take orders, he being a person of much ability"" (Ellis 255). Instead, Sheppard became a courtier. He was introduced to Nell Gwynn and became one of her favourite companions, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst (later Earl of Dorset). He would remain one of Dorset's closest friends throughout his life. While satirists and gossips (such as Anthony á Wood) said that Sheppard spent his time as ""a debauchee and atheist, a grand companion,"" others suggested that he was a fundamentally honest man who was always interested in a good joke. He became one of Charles II's dining companions, and when Nell Gwynn gave birth to a male child, he was made the steward of Gwynn's household. This prompted a satirist to accuse him of being the best paid pimp in the land. There is little truth to this charge, however, as Sheppard was not paid by the crown for his services, except for two grants of £200. Dorset and Sheppard went to Paris together. Additionally, Dorset would travel out to meet Sheppard when the latter went out to the country. Whether he and Dorset got in trouble in Paris for some scandalous behaviour, as Wood suggests, or not, it is true that Sheppard lived a very active life. He was stabbed beneath the eye while separating Henry Bulkeley and George Etheridge in a quarrel in a tavern. Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either. When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage. For this, he employed Sheppard. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf. At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen's, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen ""very merry."" In ""A New Way of Selling Places at Court"" in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly. In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter. Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others. He was one of the ones, for example, who ""discoveredParadise Lost"" when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair. He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents. He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change. Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses. In his last years, Sheppard was reported dead several times before he died. In 1694, Lord Godolphin heard a report that Sheppard had died, but Sheppard himself responded, saying that he was alive, but that he had suffered from ""the stone"" for twelve to fourteen years. In December 1697, he was again reported as dead. In July 1698, he was ""again"" reported as dead. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking ""Annual Register"" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old.

"Saint Gwenfyl
Saint Gwenfyl was an early Welsh Christian saint from the Brychan family. Little is known of her life.

Gwenc'hlan Le Scouëzec
Loïc Gwenc'hlan Le Scouëzec( 11 November 1929, Plouescat, Finistère – 6 February 2008) was a Breton writer and Grand Druid of Brittany.

Gwenllian of Wales
Gwenllian of Wales or Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn (June 1282 – 7 June 1337) was the only child of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the last native Prince of Wales . She is sometimes confused with Gwenllian ferch Gruffudd, who lived two centuries earlier.

Gwenc'hlan
Gwenc'hlan is the cognomen of a legendary 6th century Breton druid and bard called Kian, the subject and purported author of a Breton song called"" Diougan Gwenc'hlan""( Gwenc'hlan's prophecy), published by Hersart de la Villemarqué in his 1839 anthology"" Barzaz Breiz"". In this song, Gwenc'hlan is imprisoned after having his eyes gouged out for refusing to convert to Christianity, sings out that he is n't afraid to die and makes a prophecy wherein he will be avenged. The motive of the blinded prisoner is reminiscent of the historical fate of Boethius. One Gwenc'hlan or Guinclaff around 1450 wrote a"" chant royal"", or"" Dialogue between King Arthur and Gwenc'hlan"", quoted by Dom Le Pelletier and Gregory of Rostrenen. The poem was rediscovered in 1924. The Breton used by this Gwenc'hlan is already deeply pervaded by French. The legend of the 6th century bard is largely a creation of de la Villemarqué's, but he may have based his account on the 15th century author, as well as on other traditional Breton tales. He quotes 6th to 12th century Welsh poems attributed to the bards Aneurin, Taliesin and Llywarch Hen as his sources.

Iefan ab Owain Gwynedd
Iefan ab Owain Gwynedd was a son of Owain Gwynedd (the king of Gwynedd between 1137–1170) and his second wife Cristina ferch Gronw. He had a daughter named Gwenllian.

Rhain the Irishman
Rhain was an 11th- century king of Dyfed. It is unclear when his reign began. He claimed to be the son of Maredudd ab Owain and was apparently accepted as such by the people of Dyfed and the anonymous author of the C text of the"" Annals of Wales"". However, after his defeat at Abergwill and deposition by Llywelyn ap Seisyll of Gwynedd in 1022, he was recorded by the other histories of the time as Rhain the Irishman( Welsh) and treated as a pretender. The B text of the Welsh annals asserted he was killed in the battle with Llywelyn; the"" Chronicle of the Princes"", however, pointedly notes that his body was not discovered.

Edwyn ap Gwriad
Edwyn ap Gwraid was a Welsh king of Gwent from 1015 to 1045. He was imprisoned and blinded by his successor, Meurig ap Hywel, the son of Hywel ab Owain. The Anglo- Saxon name"" Edwyn"" along with Gwent's proximity to the English marches seems to imply some degree of relationship with early English rulers of the time.

Gwylog ap Beli
Gwylog ap Beli was one of the rulers of the Kingdom of Powys during the late 7th to early 8th Century, son of Beli ap Eiludd. There is also a small possibility his mother was Heledd ferch Cyndrwyn the narrator of the Canu Heledd, being that she would have been welcomed by his father Beli after the defeat at Maes Cogwy.

Gwladys
Saint Gwladys ferch Brychan or St Gladys (Latin-Gladusa), daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog, was the queen of the saint-king Gwynllyw Milwr and the mother of Cadoc ""the Wise"", whose ""vita"" may be the earliest saint's life to mention Arthur. Gwladys's other children were Cynidr, Bugi, Cyfyw, Maches, Glywys II and Egwine. Today her main church and associated school is in Bargoed.

Cyngen Glodrydd
Cyngen Glodrydd was an early 6th-century King of Powys. He was the son of King Cadell Ddyrnllwg, and was preceded on the throne by Rhyddfedd Frych, who perhaps was his uncle.

Alexandre Gaydamak
Alexandre ""Sacha"" Gaydamak (born May 1976 in France) is a French and Israeli businessman. A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandarić. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandarić remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be £32,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent £2.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.

Amadeus IX, Duke of Savoy
Amadeus IX (1 February 1435 – 30 March 1472), nicknamed the Happy, was the Duke of Savoy from 1465 to 1472. The Catholic Church venerates him with a liturgical feast on March 30.

Joan of Geneva
Joan of Geneva( born c. 1040, died 1095) was a Countess Consort of Savoy; married to Amadeus II, Count of Savoy. According to the much later"" Chronicles of Savoy"", Amadeus married Joan, daughter of"" Girard, Count of Burgundy"", which scholars have surmised to have been Count Gerold of Geneva. The"" Chronicon Altacumbae"" says only that"" the wife of Amadeus[ was] from Burgundy"", which might refer to Amadeus I. If his wife were Genevan, it would explain how the house of Savoy came so early to possess a large portion of the Genevois. His wife, whatever her name and origins, bore Amadeus II several children, although there is some uncertainty about how many:

Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy
Amadeus IV (1197 – 24 June 1253) was Count of Savoy from 1233 to 1253. Amadeus was born in Montmélian, Savoie. The legitimate heir of Thomas I of Savoy and Margaret of Geneva, he had however to fight with his brothers for the inheritance of Savoy lands after their father's death. His brothers Pietro and Aimone spurred a revolt in Aosta Valley against Amadeus, but he was able to crush it with the help of Manfred III of Saluzzo and Boniface II of Montferrat, who were his sons-in-law. Together with his brother, Thomas, he fought against the communes of Turin and Pinerolo, but with uncertain results. He was succeeded by his young son Boniface.

Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy
Amadeus VIII (4 September 1383 – 7 January 1451) was a Savoyard nobleman, the son of Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy and Bonne of Berry. He was surnamed the Peaceful. After the death of his father in 1391, his mother acted as a regent, because of his youth. He was an antipope of the Catholic Church from 1439 to 1449 as Felix V, in opposition to Popes Eugene IV and Nicholas V.

Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy
Amadeus VII (March 1360, Chambéry – 1 November 1391), known as the Red Count, was Count of Savoy from 1383 to 1391. Amadeus was the son of Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy and Bonne of Bourbon. Amadeus VII was known for his hospitality, for he would entertain people of all stations and never turned a person from his table without a meal. He married Bonne of Berry, daughter of John, Duke of Berry, who was the younger brother of Charles V of France. They had three children:
Upon his death at age 29 from tetanus, controversy arose because of his will. Amadeus VII left the important role of guardian of his son and heir, Amadeus VIII, to his own mother, a sister of the powerful Duke de Bourbon, instead of following the tradition of appointing the child's mother, who was a daughter of the equally powerful Duke de Berry. It took three months of negotiations to restore peace in the family.

Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy
Victor Amadeus I( 8 May 1587 – 7 October 1637) was the Duke of Savoy from 1630 to 1637. He was also known as the"" Lion of Susa"".

Charles Amadeus, Duke of Nemours
Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours( 12 April 162430 July 1652) was a French military leader and magnate. He was the father of the penultimate Duchess of Savoy and of a Queen of Portugal.

Amadeus IV of Geneva
Amadeus IV( died 1369) was the Count of Geneva from 1367 until his death. He was the second son of Amadeus III and Mahaut d'Auvergne. He succeeded his childless brother Aymon III in August 1367. He reversed the policy of his father and brother respecting the House of Savoy, and supported the bishops of Lausanne and Geneva against his cousin Amadeus VI of Savoy. Amadeus seems to have come to terms with his Savoyard cousin by 13 May 1368, the date on which he performed the act of homage to him for the county of Geneva. He then travelled with the count of Savoy into Italy for the campaign to bring Philip II of Piedmont to submission, and was present at Philip's trial by a stacked Savoyard court at Rivoli in September – October 1368. It is possible that the real reason for his accompanying Amadeus into Italy was to have an opportunity to speak with the Emperor, who was also in the region at that time. In February 1369 the Emperor repeated his revocation of Amadeus VI's vicariate. Amadeus IV died later that year.

Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy
Amadeus VI (4 January 1334, Chambéry – 1 March 1383, Campobasso), nicknamed the Green Count  was Count of Savoy from 1343 to 1383. He was the eldest son of Aymon, Count of Savoy and Yolande Palaeologo of Montferrat. Though he started under a regency, he showed himself to be a forceful leader, continuing Savoy's emergence as a power in Europe politically and militarily. He participated in a crusade against the Turks who were moving into Europe.

Leonora was born in Florence, where she was brought up by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Eleanor of Toledo, her aunt and namesake. Betrothed to their son Pietro at the age of 15, she blossomed under the wing of Pietro's older sister, the artistic patron Isabella, into a vivacious and witty beauty. Her marriage, like Isabella's, was not a success, and she followed her mentor's example of taking lovers. For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it. Until recently, little was known of Leonora di Garzia di Toledo, and she was not identified as the sitter of several portraits of her. The facts of her life have emerged from the growing scholarship on Isabella de' Medici, with whom she has much in common.

(She was only described as Zhang Chonghua's concubine and not as Zhang Xuanjing's mother, but there would be little reason for him to honor her as princess dowager if she were not his mother.) Because Zhang Xuanjing's uncle, the regent Zhang Tianxi, was acting dictatorially, she conspired with officials led by Zhang Qin (張欽) to kill Zhang Tianxi, but the news leaked, and Zhang Tianxi had Zhang Qin put to death. (This implies that Princess Dowager Guo was not put to death.) Zhang Xuanjing, in fear, offered to yield the throne to Zhang Tianxi, but Zhang Tianxi refused. However, a month later, he sent soldiers into the palace and assassinated the 13-year-old duke. He himself took the Jin-created title the Duke of Xiping, which his nephew had held.

Prasanna Jayakody
Prasanna Jayakody ( In Sinhalese: ප් රසන්න ජයකොඩි) is a prominent Sri Lankan film director and screenwriter, internationally well- recognized for his distinctive cinematic accomplishments in contemporary Sri Lankan cinema. Philosophy and silver screen harmonize at their finest with Jayakody in his movies, which primarily explore the human state of mind. His movies stand out as fusions of human emotions, senses and thoughts contrastingly set against the fractured socio- economic- cultural and religious canvas of Sri Lanka. At a global context, Jayakody ’s cinema resonates the psychological- biological realities of mankind and arbitraries of human cognition against the concept of civilization. Jayakody ’s eccentric cinematic world, in the absence of a flowing story, capitalizes on subtle but detailed images and intense characters.

Alcohol laws of Texas
An operator of a motor vehicle is considered automatically under the influence of alcohol if a chemical screening shows a blood - alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08 percent or greater. If under the age of 21, a driver in Texas is not able to test positive for any blood - alcohol content (BAC) under penalty of DUI charges.

Beer
The alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily ""light"" beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.

"Beli ap Eiludd
Beli ap Eiludd was a 7th- century King of Powys. Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. It is more likely however that as the genealogies state he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf, the former being the most likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw painting the Mathrafal dynasty as being descendants of Selyf. It was also likely if Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.

Eiludd Powys
Eiludd Powys was an early 7th-century King of Powys. One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf ""Sarffgadau"" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.

Gwylog ap Beli
Gwylog ap Beli was one of the rulers of the Kingdom of Powys during the late 7th to early 8th Century, son of Beli ap Eiludd. There is also a small possibility his mother was Heledd ferch Cyndrwyn the narrator of the Canu Heledd, being that she would have been welcomed by his father Beli after the defeat at Maes Cogwy.

Llywelyn ap Merfyn
Llywelyn ap Merfyn( died 942) was an early 10th- century King of Powys, son of Merfyn ap Rhodri, and grandson of Rhodri the Great.

Owain Gwynedd

He was called ""Owain the Great"" (Welsh: ""Owain Mawr"") and the first to be styled ""Prince of Wales"". He is considered to be the most successful of all the North Welsh princes prior to his grandson, Llywelyn the Great. He became known as Owain Gwynedd (""Owain of Gwynedd"") to distinguish him from the contemporary king of Powys Wenwynwyn, Owain ap Gruffydd ap Maredudd, who became known as Owain Cyfeiliog.

Tegwared y Bais Wen
Tegwared y Bais Wen ap Llywelyn( English: Tegwared with the White Mantle/ Escutcheon, son of Llewelyn), Lord of Trefdraeth was a natural son of Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Aberffraw, by a woman in some sources given as Crysten. He was born circa 1210. ' The white mantle' refers to his coat of arms( as shown to the right). Tegwared served as a General in his father's army and held the Lordship of Trefdraeth, Anglesey, where his posterity lived for the next 600 years. It is recorded that he was adopted and raised by Ednyfed Vychan, his father's Seneschal. Tegwared later married his daughter, Gwenlian ferch Ednyfed Vychan. They had the following children:

Gruffudd ab Owain Glyndŵr
Gruffudd ap Owain Glyndŵr( c.1375 -c.1412) was the eldest son of Margaret Hanmer and Owain Glyndŵr the disinherited Prince of the old Royal house of Powys Fadog who led a major revolt in Wales between 1400 and c. 1416.

Gwenllian of Wales
Gwenllian of Wales or Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn (June 1282 – 7 June 1337) was the only child of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the last native Prince of Wales . She is sometimes confused with Gwenllian ferch Gruffudd, who lived two centuries earlier.

Maredudd ap Bleddyn
Maredudd ap Bleddyn (1047 – 9 February 1132) was a prince and later King of Powys in eastern Wales. Maredudd was the son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn who was King of both Powys and Gwynedd. When Bleddyn was killed in 1075, Powys was divided between three of his sons, Iorwerth, Cadwgan and Maredudd.

Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd
Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd (c. 1100 – 1172) was the third son of Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd, and brother of Owain Gwynedd.

William S. Burroughs Jr.
William Seward Burroughs III (July 21, 1947 – March 3, 1981) was an American novelist, also known as William S. Burroughs Jr. and Billy Burroughs. He bears the name of both his father and his great grandfather, William Seward Burroughs I, the original inventor of the Burroughs adding machine. He wrote three novels, two of which were published as ""Speed"" (1970) and ""Kentucky Ham"" (1973). His third novel, ""Prakriti Junction,"" begun in 1977, was never completed, although extracts from it were included in his third and final published work ""Cursed From Birth"". Burroughs Jr. underwent a liver transplant in 1976 after developing cirrhosis. He died in 1981, at the age of 33, from alcoholism and liver failure. Burroughs Jr. appears briefly in the 1983 documentary , about his father, in which he discusses his childhood, his liver problems, and his relationship with his family. In the documentary, John Giorno calls him ""the last beatnik.""

Edgar Rice Burroughs
Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 – March 19, 1950) was an American fiction writer best known for his celebrated and prolific output in the adventure and science-fiction genres. Among the most notable of his creations are the jungle hero Tarzan, the heroic Mars adventurer John Carter, and the fictional landmass within Earth known as Pellucidar.

William S. Burroughs
William Seward Burroughs II (February 5, 1914 – August 2, 1997) was an American writer and visual artist. Burroughs was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was also briefly known by the pen name William Lee. Burroughs created and exhibited thousands of paintings and other visual artworks, including his celebrated 'Gunshot Paintings'. He was born into a wealthy family in St. Louis, Missouri, grandson of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation, William Seward Burroughs I, and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties. He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University, studied English, and anthropology as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy, after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life, while working a variety of jobs. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, and out of their mutual influence grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture. Much of Burroughs' work is semiautobiographical, primarily drawn from his experiences as a heroin addict, as he lived throughout Mexico City, London, Paris and the Tangier International Zone near Morocco, as well as from his travels in the South American Amazon. His work also features frequent mystical, occult or otherwise magical themes – a constant preoccupation for Burroughs, both in fiction and in real life. Burroughs killed his second wife, Joan Vollmer, in 1951 in Mexico City. Burroughs initially claimed that he shot Vollmer while drunkenly attempting a ""William Tell"" stunt. He later told investigators a different story: that he had been showing his pistol to friends, when it fell and hit the table, firing the bullet that killed Vollmer. After Burroughs returned to the United States, he was convicted of manslaughter ""in absentia"", and received a two-year suspended sentence. Burroughs found success with his confessional first novel, ""Junkie"" (1953), but he is perhaps best known for his third novel ""Naked Lunch"" (1959), a highly controversial work that was the subject of a court case after it was challenged as being in violation of the U.S. sodomy laws. With Brion Gysin, he also popularized the literary cut-up technique in works such as The Nova Trilogy (1961–1964). In 1983, Burroughs was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and in 1984 he was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France. Jack Kerouac called Burroughs the ""greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift"", a reputation he owes to his ""lifelong subversion"" of the moral, political, and economic systems of modern American society, articulated in often darkly humorous sardonicism. J. G. Ballard considered Burroughs to be ""the most important writer to emerge since the Second World War"", while Norman Mailer declared him ""the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius"". Burroughs created visual art throughout his lifetime, but never exhibited it until 1987, after the death of his friend and collaborator Brion Gysin. For the next and last 10 years of his life, he presented his paintings and drawings at museums and galleries worldwide. Burroughs had one child, William S. Burroughs Jr. (1947–1981), with his second wife Joan Vollmer. William Burroughs died at his home in Lawrence, Kansas, after suffering a heart attack in 1997.

In Boston in 1838 Sarah Grimké published The Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women, which was widely circulated.

Second-wave feminism
Though it is widely accepted that the movement lasted from the 1960s into the early 1980s, the exact years of the movement are more difficult to pinpoint and are often disputed. The movement is usually believed to have begun in 1963, when ``Mother of the Movement ''Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique, and President John F. Kennedy's Presidential Commission on the Status of Women released its report on gender inequality. The report revealed, that there was gender inequality, but also recommended changing it by giving paid maternity leave, greater access to education, and help with child care, along with Friedan's book, which spoke to the discontent of many women (especially housewives), led to the formation of many local, state, and federal government women's groups as well as many independent feminist organizations. Friedan was referencing a`` movement'' as early as 1964.

"𝕊
𝕊 is the blackboard bold “ S ” letter. It can refer to:

Slavs
Conversely, some Slavs were assimilated into other populations. Although the majority continued south, attracted by the riches of the territory which would become Bulgaria, a few remained in the Carpathian basin and were ultimately assimilated into the Magyar or Romanian population. There is a large number of river names and other placenames of Slavic origin in Romania.[better source needed]

Slavs
^8 This identity continues to be used by a minority throughout the former Yugoslav republics. The nationality is also declared by diasporans living in the USA and Canada. There are a multitude of reasons as to why people prefer this affiliation, some published on the article.

Slavs
Alternative proposals for the etymology of *Slověninъ propounded by some scholars have much less support. Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of worshipper, in this context meaning ""practicer of a common Slavic religion,"" and from that evolved into an ethnonym. S.B. Bernstein speculates that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European *(s)lawos, cognate to Ancient Greek λαός laós ""population, people,"" which itself has no commonly accepted etymology. Meanwhile, others have pointed out that the suffix -enin indicates a man from a certain place, which in this case should be a place called Slova or Slava, possibly a river name. The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek (1907–1986) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slovene.

Southern Europe
Several South Slavic languages are spoken by millions of people in Southern Europe. Serbian is spoken in Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia; Bulgarian is spoken in Bulgaria; Croatian is spoken in Croatia and Bosnia; Bosnian is spoken in Bosnia; Slovene is spoken in Slovenia; and Macedonian is spoken in Macedonia.

Bolshaya Pyora
Did you mean:

Slavs
Slavic standard languages which are official in at least one country: Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, and Ukrainian. The alphabet depends on what religion is usual for the respective Slavic ethnic groups. The Orthodox use the Cyrillic alphabet and the Roman Catholics use Latin alphabet, the Bosniaks who are Muslims also use the Latin. Few Greek Roman and Roman Catholics use the Cyrillic alphabet however. The Serbian language and Montenegrin language uses both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. There is also a Latin script to write in Belarusian, called the Lacinka alphabet.

Serbo-Croatian
Like most Slavic languages, there are mostly three genders for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, a distinction which is still present even in the plural (unlike Russian and, in part, the Čakavian dialect). They also have two numbers: singular and plural. However, some consider there to be three numbers (paucal or dual, too), since (still preserved in closely related Slovene) after two (dva, dvije/dve), three (tri) and four (četiri), and all numbers ending in them (e.g. twenty-two, ninety-three, one hundred four) the genitive singular is used, and after all other numbers five (pet) and up, the genitive plural is used. (The number one [jedan] is treated as an adjective.) Adjectives are placed in front of the noun they modify and must agree in both case and number with it.

Russian language
The Northern Russian dialects and those spoken along the Volga River typically pronounce unstressed /o/ clearly (the phenomenon called okanye/оканье). Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have high or diphthongal /e~i̯ɛ/ in the place of Proto-Slavic *ě and /o~u̯ɔ/ in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian /e/ and /o/. An interesting morphological feature is a post-posed definite article -to, -ta, -te similarly to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.

Slavs
The Slavic autonym *Slověninъ is usually considered (e.g. by Roman Jakobson) a derivation from slovo ""word"", originally denoting ""people who speak (the same language),"" i.e. people who understand each other, in contrast to the Slavic word denoting ""foreign people"" – němci, meaning ""mumbling, murmuring people"" (from Slavic *němъ – ""mumbling, mute"").

To promote ""Lolita"", LaBelle sang an acoustic version for ""Rap-Up"", and performed the original version at various venues, such as New York Fashion Week and the Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend. Directed by Diane Martel, the single's accompanying music video features LaBelle as Lolita and shows how she seduces boys from her neighborhood. The video received attention due to its focus on sexuality. Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church strongly criticized Martel's creation of sexually-explicit music videos, and Idolator selected the carwash scene as an instance in which the video emphasized sexuality. Despite the criticism, LaBelle's performance garnered positive reviews.

Hair transplantation
Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding, (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face - lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.

Madison Hemings, born James Madison Hemings (18 January 1805 – 28 November 1877), was the son of the mixed-race slave Sally Hemings.

Born into slavery by his mother's status, he was freed by the will of Jefferson in 1826. Based on historical and DNA evidence, historians widely agree that Jefferson was probably the father of all Hemings' children. At the age of 68, Madison Hemings claimed the connection in an 1873 Ohio newspaper interview, titled, ""Life Among the Lowly,"" which attracted national and international attention. 1998 DNA tests demonstrate a match between the Y-chromosome of a descendant of his brother, Eston Hemings Jefferson, and that of the male Jefferson line.

A wagon prototype was built but the bodystyle was not put into production. In 1954, Holden's first exports began with sales of the FJ in New Zealand. The FJ, of monocoque construction, broadly followed the silhouette of its predecessor, but featured a bolder horizontal styled front grille, along with comfort and decoration upgrades in a new sedan model named the' Holden Special'. Originally specified as achieved at 3,800 rpm, the claimed maximum power output from the six- cylinder engine was increased to achieved at 4,000 rpm. In 1955 the car underwent a mild interior facelift for the Holden Special sedan, along with a variation in paint and trim options. The FJ series was progressively replaced by models from the Holden FE series from July 1956 to May 1957 with a total of 169,969 examples produced.

Samurai
Jidaigeki (literally historical drama) has always been a staple program on Japanese movies and television. The programs typically feature a samurai. Samurai films and westerns share a number of similarities and the two have influenced each other over the years. One of Japan’s most renowned directors, Akira Kurosawa, greatly influenced the samurai aspect in western film-making.[citation needed] George Lucas’ Star Wars series incorporated many aspects from the Seven Samurai film. One example is that in the Japanese film, seven samurai warriors are hired by local farmers to protect their land from being overrun by bandits; In George Lucas’ Star Wars: A New Hope, a similar situation arises. Kurosawa was inspired by the works of director John Ford and in turn Kurosawa's works have been remade into westerns such as The Seven Samurai into The Magnificent Seven and Yojimbo into A Fistful of Dollars. There is also a 26 episode anime adaptation (Samurai 7) of The Seven Samurai. Along with film, literature containing samurai influences are seen as well.

"Romulus (son of Anthemius)
Romulus (fl. 469–479 AD) was a member of the House of Theodosius, son of Western Roman Emperor Anthemius.

Publius Vitellius the Elder
__NoToC__ Publius Vitellius, grandfather of the emperor Vitellius, was a Roman eques who lived during the time of Augustus. He was a procurator in the time of Augustus.

Roman mythology
The Aeneid and Livy's early history are the best extant sources for Rome's founding myths. Material from Greek heroic legend was grafted onto this native stock at an early date. The Trojan prince Aeneas was cast as husband of Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus, patronymical ancestor of the Latini, and therefore through a convoluted revisionist genealogy as forebear of Romulus and Remus. By extension, the Trojans were adopted as the mythical ancestors of the Roman people.

Anthemius
Anthemius (– 11 July 472) was Western Roman Emperor from 467 to 472. Perhaps the last capable Western Roman Emperor, Anthemius attempted to solve the two primary military challenges facing the remains of the Western Roman Empire: the resurgent Visigoths, under Euric, whose domain straddled the Pyrenees; and the unvanquished Vandals, under Geiseric, in undisputed control of North Africa. Anthemius was killed by Ricimer, his own general of Gothic descent, who contested power with him.

Virgil
Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet. Gregory of Tours read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with some other Latin poets, though he cautions that ""we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death.""

Old World oriole
The Old World orioles( Oriolidae) are an Old World family of passerine birds.

Marcus Antonius (orator)
Marcus Antonius( born 143 BC- died 87 BC) was a Roman politician of the Antonius family and one of the most distinguished Roman orators of his time. He was also the grandfather of the famous general and triumvir, Mark Antony.

Anthemius (praetorian prefect)
Flavius Anthemius("" floruit"" 400-414) was a high- ranking official of the late Roman Empire. He is notable as a praetorian prefect of the East and effective regent of the Eastern Roman Empire during the later reign of Arcadius and the first years of Theodosius II, during which time he supervised the construction of the first set of the famous Theodosian Walls.

Tigellius
Tigellius( 1st century BC – 40 BC), was a lyric poet during the time of Julius Caesar. The little information we have about him derives from the Satires of Horace and some letters of Cicero. From them we know that he was a Sardinian, a fine singer and a close friend of Julius Caesar.

Roman Republic
Roman literature was from its very inception influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest works we possess are of historical epics telling the early military history of Rome. As the republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy. Virgil represents the pinnacle of Roman epic poetry. His Aeneid tells the story of flight of Aeneas from Troy and his settlement of the city that would become Rome.[citation needed] Lucretius, in his On the Nature of Things, attempted to explicate science in an epic poem. The genre of satire was common in Rome, and satires were written by, among others, Juvenal and Persius. The rhetorical works of Cicero are considered[by whom?] to be some of the best bodies of correspondence recorded in antiquity.[citation needed]

Will Hay shared directorial credit with Basil Dearden following on from their previous collaboration, The Black Sheep of Whitehall.

The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity"". Cinemalead.com rated it with 4/5 stars and said ""Overall if you prefer to watch a gutsy film which is different and unique from the routine Tamil cinema, go and watch Goli Soda which surely deserves a repeated viewing"".

"Mercia
When Æthelflæd died in 918, Ælfwynn, her daughter by Æthelred, succeeded as 'Second Lady of the Mercians', but within six months Edward had deprived her of all authority in Mercia and taken her into Wessex.

Osthryth
Osthryth (died 697), queen of the Mercians, was the wife of King Æthelred and daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his second wife Eanflæd. She probably married Æthelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhflæd had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhflæd's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means ""stronghold of Flæde"", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s Æthelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by Æthelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that Æthelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. Æthelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. Æthelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against Æthelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother Ælfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was ""a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King Æthelred had married his sister."" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of Æthelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.

Æthelred of Mercia
Æthelred (died after 704) was King of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, Æthelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain. He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. Æthelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; Æthelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria. Æthelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 Æthelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. Æthelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was Æthelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that Æthelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.

Eadwig Ætheling
Eadwig, who was now the last surviving son by his father's first marriage, was banished in 1016 and then outlawed in 1017 by Cnut, however he was reconciled with Cnut the same year and allowed to live in England, but was murdered soon after at the instigation of Cnut, possibly after attempting to rally resistance in the south west. The Anglo-Saxon claim to the throne then passed to the elder son of Æthelred's second marriage, the future Edward the Confessor. Eadwig was buried at Tavistock Abbey a place built by his uncle Ordwulf.

Westminster Abbey
Henry III rebuilt the abbey in honour of a royal saint, Edward the Confessor, whose relics were placed in a shrine in the sanctuary. Henry III himself was interred nearby, as were many of the Plantagenet kings of England, their wives and other relatives. Until the death of George II of Great Britain in 1760, most kings and queens were buried in the abbey, some notable exceptions being Henry VI, Edward IV, Henry VIII and Charles I who are buried in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Other exceptions include Richard III, now buried at Leicester Cathedral, and the de facto queen Lady Jane Grey, buried in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London. Most monarchs and royals who died after 1760 are buried either in St George's Chapel or at Frogmore to the east of Windsor Castle.[citation needed]

Beornwulf of Mercia
Beornwulf( died 826) was King of Mercia( roughly the Midlands of England) from 823 to 826. His short reign saw the collapse of Mercia's supremacy over the other kingdoms of the Anglo- Saxon Heptarchy.

Leofric, Earl of Mercia
Leofric (died 31 August or 30 September 1057) was an Earl of Mercia. He founded monasteries at Coventry and Much Wenlock. Leofric is most remembered as the husband of Lady Godiva.

Æthelric son of Æthelmund
Æthelric, is thought to have succeeded his father, Æthelmund, as Ealdorman of Hwicce. In 804 Æthelric issued a charter in which he gave land to his mother, Ceolburh, presumably Æthelmund's widow.

Battle of Tettenhall
The Battle of Tettenhall (sometimes called the Battle of Wednesfield or Wōdnesfeld) took place, according to the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"", near Tettenhall on 5 August 910. The allied forces of Mercia and Wessex met an army of Northumbrian Vikings in Mercia.

But this is a ruse to kidnap her and use her as bait for Dexter. Rudy's clues lead Dexter back to his childhood home, where Rudy is holding Debra. Dexter recalls now that he had an older brother who was also in the container when their mother Laura was murdered. Rudy Cooper is actually his older brother, Brian Moser, who was not adopted and spent much of his life in mental institutions. Like Dexter, he is a serial killer but not bound by a moral code. Rudy reveals that he has been searching for Dexter for years and was happy to realize that his younger brother was also a killer. For months now, he has been leading Dexter to him and helping his younger brother recover the memories of their shared childhood trauma. Rudy then reveals a room covered in plastic, where an unconscious Debra is naked and taped to a table. Rudy has arranged the room to be just as Dexter prefers for his own kills, and says that they will kill Debra together to cement their bond as brothers. Dexter says he wo n't kill Debra and Brian protests that his brother ``ca n't be a killer AND a hero. ''Dexter saves Debra from Brian just as she wakes up and Brian escapes as the police arrive.

"Meritaten
Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty. Her name means ""She who is beloved of Aten""; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped. She held several titles, performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare, who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten. Meritaten also may have served as pharaoh in her own right under the name, Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten.

Meritaten Tasherit
Meritaten Tasherit, which means ""Meritaten the Younger"" was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Questions!/Answers?
What is the importance of history in designers and architects life?

Robert Adam
Robert Adam (3 July 1728 – 3 March 1792) was a Scottish neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer. He was the son of William Adam (1689–1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the ""Adam Style"", and his theory of ""movement"" in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses. He served as the member of Parliament for Kinross-shire from 1768 to 1774.

James Adam (architect)
James Adam (21 July 1732 – 20 October 1794) was a Scottish architect and furniture designer, but was often overshadowed by his older brother and business partner, Robert Adam. They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the ""Grand Tour"", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768–1772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771–5 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived — he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, ""Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam"" (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

James Adam (classicist)
James Adam( 1860–1907) was a Scottish classicist who taught Classics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

William Adam (architect)
William Adam (1689 – 24 June 1748) was a Scottish architect, mason, and entrepreneur. He was the foremost architect of his time in Scotland, designing and building numerous country houses and public buildings, and often acting as contractor as well as architect. Among his best known works are Hopetoun House near Edinburgh, and Duff House in Banff. His individual, exuberant style built on the Palladian style, but with Baroque details inspired by Vanbrugh and Continental architecture. In the 18th century, Adam was considered Scotland's ""Universal Architect"". However, since the early 20th century, architectural critics have taken a more measured view, Colin McWilliam, for instance, finding the quality of his work ""varied to an extreme degree"". As well as being an architect, Adam was involved in several industrial ventures and improvement schemes, including coal mining, salt panning, stone quarries and mills. In 1731 he began to build up his own estate in Kinross-shire, which he named Blair Adam. He was the father of three architects; John, Robert and James, the last two were the developers of the ""Adam style"".

"English Renaissance
The English theatre scene, which performed both for the court and nobility in private performances, and a very wide public in the theatres, was the most crowded in Europe, with a host of other playwrights as well as the giant figures of Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Elizabeth herself was a product of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham, and wrote occasional poems such as On Monsieur's Departure at critical moments of her life. Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon. All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated, as was much of the nobility, and Italian literature had a considerable following, providing the sources for many of Shakespeare's plays. English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method, a forerunner of the Scientific Method. The language of the Book of Common Prayer, first published in 1549, and at the end of the period the Authorised Version (``King James Version ''to Americans) of the Bible (1611) had enduring impacts on the English consciousness.

"Meritites II
Meritites II (Merytiotes, Meritetes) or Meritites A (""beloved of her father"") was a 4th dynasty Princess of Ancient Egypt, and probably a daughter of King Khufu. She may have been a daughter of Meritites I based on the fact that this queen is mentioned in mastaba G 7650.

Meritaten Tasherit
Meritaten Tasherit, which means ""Meritaten the Younger"" was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Meritaten
Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty. Her name means ""She who is beloved of Aten""; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped. She held several titles, performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare, who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten.

Aaron
Knowledge of Aaron, along with his brother Moses, comes exclusively from religious texts, such as the Bible and Qur'an. The Hebrew Bible relates that, unlike Moses, who grew up in the Egyptian royal court, Aaron and his elder sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border - land of Egypt (Goshen). When Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites, Aaron served as his brother's spokesman (``prophet '') to the Pharaoh. Part of the Law (Torah) that Moses received from God at Sinai granted Aaron the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites. Aaron died before the Israelites crossed the North Jordan river and he was buried on Mount Hor (Numbers 33: 39; Deuteronomy 10: 6 says he died and was buried at Moserah). Aaron is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible.

Shattered Image
Shattered Image is a 1998 thriller film written by Duane Poole and directed by Chilean filmmaker Raúl Ruiz. It stars William Baldwin, Anne Parillaud and Lisanne Falk. According to academic Michael Goddard, this is a confusing and surreal film about complicated identities which ""parallel David Lynch's moebius strip style films also dealing with parallel identities and realities that he was making at [the same] time, ""Lost Highway"" (1997) and ""Mulholland Dr."" (2001)."" In an interview with film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, Ruiz calls ""Shattered Image"" an ""American accident."" He explains some of his opinions and experiences of the top to down ""disconnected"" filmmaking process in America. Ruiz says, Shattered Image"", I fought to make, and I now have a film about what it means to make a film in America - why American movies are the way they are. It's a very strange film because I thought about it in the terms of American movies. In the American cinema there are good guys and bad guys. The good guys are the artists, let's say the filmmakers, and the bad guys are the actors, sometimes the producers. I found new bad guys, who were the technicians, the workers, who were so obviously disconnected with the project, with the story of the movie. In France, you can get a good price from an electrician if he likes a script, if he finds it interesting and not very commercial he can, let’s say, work Saturdays for free. And I thought that the relationship with the producer was ambiguous because he had the money coming from everywhere and he had to deal with those other producers, and everyone had a very precise idea about the movie. And the discussion was at the level of where to put the camera. That was new for me. The idea that I decided where to put the camera was new to them. The editor was the director, and not the cameraman.""

He seems to have been the only who escaped Eric II's murder of Harald and his sons in 1135. After trying in vain to regain his heritage, Olaf proclaimed himself king in Scania in 1139, fighting his cousin King Eric III of Denmark. The civil war mostly consisted of alternating raids, during which Olaf killed Bishop Rike of Roskilde, an act that saw him excommunicated by the Pope.

William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey
William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey( died 11 May 1138) was the son of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey and his first wife Gundred. He was more often referred to as"" Earl Warenne"" or"" Earl of Warenne"" than as Earl of Surrey.

William de Warenne (1256-1286)
William de Warenne (9 February 1256 – 15 December 1286) was the only son of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey and his wife Alice de Lusignan.

William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey

Isabel de Warenne, Countess of Surrey
Isabel de Warenne, 4th Countess of Surrey( c. 1137 c. 1203) was an English peer. She was the only surviving heir of William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey and his wife, Adela, the daughter of William III of Ponthieu.

William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey
William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, Lord of Lewes, Seigneur de Varennes (died 1088), was a Norman nobleman created Earl of Surrey under William II Rufus. He is among the few who are documented as having fought for William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. At the time of the Domesday Survey, he held extensive lands in 13 counties, including the Rape of Lewes in Sussex, which is now divided between the ceremonial counties of East Sussex and West Sussex.

Alice de Warenne, Countess of Arundel
Alice de Warenne, Countess of Arundel( 15 June 1287 – 23 May 1338) was an English noblewoman and heir apparent to the Earldom of Surrey. In 1305, she married Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel.

William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey
William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey( died 27 May 1240) was the son of Hamelin de Warenne and Isabel, daughter of William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey. His father Hamelin granted him the manor of Appleby, North Lincolnshire. De Warenne was present at the coronation of John, King of England on 27 May 1199. When Normandy was lost to the French in 1204 he lost his Norman holdings( in 1202 he was lieutenant of Gascony), but John recompensed him with Grantham and Stamford. His first tenure of office as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports began in 1204, and lasted until 1206; he was again appointed as Warden in 1214. He was also a Warden of the Welsh Marches between 1208 and 1213. Between the years 1200 and 1208, and between 1217 and 1226 he was to serve as the High Sheriff of Surrey. William was one of the few barons who remained loyal to King John( who was his cousin. In 1212, when a general rebellion was feared, John committed to him the custody of the northern shires. During the king's difficulties with the barons, when they sought for the French prince to assume the English throne, William is listed as one of those who advised John to accede to"" Magna Carta"". His allegiance only faltered a few times when the king's cause looked hopeless; shortly before the death of John, he made terms with Prince Louis. In March 1217 he again demonstrated his loyalty to England by supporting the young King Henry III, and he was also responsible for the establishment of Salisbury Cathedral. However, he disliked the royal favourites who came into power after 1227, and used his influence to protect Hubert de Burgh when the latter had been removed from office by their efforts in 1232. Warenne's relations with the king became strained in course of time. In 1238 he was evidently regarded as a leader of the baronial opposition, for the Great Council appointed him as one of the treasurers who were to prevent the king from squandering the subsidy voted in that year. William married Maud Marshal, on 13 October 1225. They had a son and a daughter. The son John( 1231–1304) succeeded his father as earl, while the daughter, Isabel de Warenne( c. 1228–1282), married Hugh d' Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel.

[1138-1150], d. 24 December 1193), also called William de Albini III, was the son of William d'Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel and Adeliza of Louvain, widow of Henry I of England. He married Maud de St. Hilary and among their children was William d'Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel. The Duke of Norfolk's Archives Assistant Librarian Sara Rodger wrote that William ""did have three sons, William who succeeded him as Earl in 1196, and Alan and Geoffrey, of whom we know nothing.""

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow: An eccentric pirate characterized by his slightly drunken swagger, slurred speech and awkwardly flailing hand gestures. He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name ""Jack Sparrow""; however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, ""a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate."" At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards. Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, ""He's ruining the film!"" Depp answered back, ""Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot.""

"Gilduin of Le Puiset
Gilduin of Le Puiset( d. between 1130 and 1135) was the son of Hugh I of Le Puiset and Alice of Monthléry, daughter of Guy I of Montlhéry. Monk at St. Martin- des- Champs, prior at Cluny Abbey, prior at Lurey- le- Bourg, abbot of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat. It is unclear when Gilduin became abbot of St. Mary, but he was in this position when his cousin Baldwin II confirmed the privileges of the abbey, the chief Marian shrine in Jerusalem, on 31 January 1120. In that same year, Gilduin and Baldwin II travelled to Edessa, joining with Gilduin ’s brother Waleran. There they met Hugh, Archbishop of Edessa. Hugh, in possession of two sacred relics — a finger of St. Stephen and a tooth of John the Baptist- was concerned about keeping the relics in a place that could be overrun by Moslems. He gave the relics to Gilduin for transfer to Cluny, now under Pons of Melgueil, a mission which he completed. Gilduin may have been associated with Barisan the Old. "" Les Lignages d’ Outremer"" identified Balian[ Barisan] as the brother of a Count Guilduin of Chartres. Riley- Smith speculates that Barisan may have been the illegitimate brother or brother- in- law of Gilduin, but there is little evidence to support this. It is not known who succeeded Gilduin as abbot of St. Mary.

List of most expensive films

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow: An eccentric pirate characterized by his slightly drunken swagger, slurred speech and awkwardly flailing hand gestures. He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name ""Jack Sparrow""; however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, ""a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate."" At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards. Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, ""He's ruining the film!"" Depp answered back, ""Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot.""

The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity"". Cinemalead.com rated it with 4/5 stars and said ""Overall if you prefer to watch a gutsy film which is different and unique from the routine Tamil cinema, go and watch Goli Soda which surely deserves a repeated viewing"".

"Neith (wife of Pepi II)
Neith was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, one of the principal queens of the Old Kingdom pharaoh Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled (c. 2278 BC – c. 2184 BC). Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.

Ankhesenpepi IV
Ankhesenpepi IV was an ancient Egyptian queen, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi II of the Sixth dynasty. She was the mother of King Neferkare II. Pepi II also had several other wives.

Iput II
Iput was an ancient Egyptian queen consort of the Sixth dynasty, a sister and wife of Pepi II.

Ankhesenpepi II
Ankhesenpepi II or Ankhesenmeryre II was a queen consort during the sixth dynasty of Egypt. She was the wife of Kings Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, and the mother of Pepi II. She was buried in a pyramid in Saqqara.

Pepi II Neferkare
Pepi II (also Pepy II; 2284 BC – after 2247 BC, probably either 2216 or 2184 BC) was a pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt's Old Kingdom who reigned from 2278 BC. His throne name, Neferkare (""Nefer-ka-Re""), means ""Beautiful is the Ka of Re"". He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks—the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II—were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: ""King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II"". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.

Iput
Iput I was a Queen of Egypt, a daughter of King Unas, the last king of the Fifth dynasty of Egypt. She married Teti, the first Pharaoh of the Sixth dynasty of Egypt. Their son was Pepi I Meryre.

Herneith
Herneith was a Queen consort of ancient Egypt. She lived during the 1st dynasty. The name Herneith means"" The face of Neith"".

Nefertkau III
Nefertkau III was an Ancient Egyptian princess. She lived during the 4th dynasty. She was possibly a daughter of Meresankh II and Horbaef. If so, she was a granddaughter of King Khufu. Baud has proposed that Nefertkau was a daughter of Khufu instead. Nefertkau has the titles ""King's daughter of his body"" and ""Priestess of Neith"" in a scene in the chapel of her tomb. She was married to an official named Iynefer. Nefertkau and Iynefer had a daughter also called Nefertkau and two or three sons. Strudwick has suggested that Iynefer may be a son of Khufu. Depending on the interpretation of the family relationships Nefertkau may have married either her uncle or her brother.

Sebat (king's daughter)
Sebat was an Ancient Egyptian king's daughter of the Twelfth Dynasty. Her only known title is"" king's daughter of his body"". She is so far only attested on the back slab of a statue base found at Serabit el- Khadim on Sinai. The statues are now lost but once depicted a falcon, king Amenemhat I and king Senusret I. The inscription mentions at the top Amenemhat II and in a lower register Senusret I, the king's daughter Sebat, the king's wife Neferu, Amenemhat I and again Senusret I. From this evidence it seems clear that Sebat was the daughter of Senusret I and Neferu and the sister of Amenemhat II.

Isetnofret (daughter of Khaemwaset)
Isetnofret was an Ancient Egyptian woman and daughter of the high priest of Ptah and king's son Khaemweset( lived around 1200 BC). She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called"" daughter of his body"". On a relief found at Saqqara she is called"" his beloved daughter"" and"" king's daughter"". Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the"" noble woman"" Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.

Where was the place of burial of Neith (Wife Of Pepi Ii)'s husband?";The place of burial was Saqqara.;Saqqara

Lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, either as a device on shields or as supporters, but the lioness is used much less frequently.

S. Lewis, and the comedic Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

The 1960s saw the appearance of the Kenyan lioness Elsa in the movie Born Free, which is based on the factual book of the same title.

"Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 6)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 30 BC – 33 AD) was a Roman senator, politician and general, praised by the historian Tacitus.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger or Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor( died 30 BC), was the only child of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and his wife Junia Secunda, a half- sister to Brutus the Younger, one of Julius Caesar's assassins.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, (6–39) was the son of consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. He and his sister Aemilia Lepida were both married to siblings of the Emperor Caligula (Aemilia married Caligula's elder brother Drusus Caesar; Lepidus married to Caligula's younger sister Julia Drusilla). He was also great-grandson of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul of 50 BC and brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Some areas of his lineage are unclear. However, through his mother Julia the Younger, Lepidus was the great grandson of Emperor Augustus Caesar. Lepidus married Caligula's sister Drusilla sometime in November or December of 37. Little is known about him prior to this. Drusilla had been married to Lucius Cassius Longinus since 33 but Caligula forced his brother-in-law to divorce Drusilla so that she could marry Lepidus. The marriage lasted until Drusilla's death in June 38. They had no children. Because of this marriage, Lepidus had become a close friend to Caligula and his family. After the death of Gemellus in 37, Lepidus was publicly marked by Caligula as his heir. In late 38, when the governor of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus was arrested, Lepidus successfully persuaded Caligula to exile Flaccus to Andros rather than Gyarus. Sometime in 39, however, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla that detailed an adulterous affair with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor. Lepidus was executed and Caligula's sisters were exiled. Agrippina was given the bones of Lepidus in an urn, and she carried them to Rome. Caligula sent three daggers to the Temple of Mars the Avenger to celebrate the death. In the Senate, Vespasian made a motion that the remains of Lepidus be thrown away instead of buried. The motion was carried and Lepidus was not given a proper burial.

Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus
Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (flourished 1st century BC) was the brother of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and son to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the consul of 78 BC. His mother may have been a daughter of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (78 BC)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( 120 BC – 77 BC) was a Roman statesman and general. After the death of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, he attempted to undermine the Sullan constitution and revive the"" populares"" faction. This brought him into conflict with the optimates whom Sulla had put back in power. In 77 BC, when he was recalled from his proconsulship of Gaul, he returned to Rome at the head of an army and an armed conflict erupted. Lepidus' forces were defeated in a battle near the Milvian Bridge and as a result his rebellion failed. He was the father of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and of one of the consuls for 50 BC Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus.

Aemilia Lepida (fiancee of Claudius)
Aemilia Lepida( 5 BC – c. 43 AD) was a noble Roman woman and matron. She was the eldest daughter and first- born child of Julia the Younger( the first granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus) and consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. Her father was of a distinguished and ancient patrician family. She was the first great- grandchild of Emperor Augustus, noblewoman Scribonia and a great- grandchild of consul Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus( brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Aemilia Lepida was the sister of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( 6 -39) who was married to Caligula's favorite sister Drusilla and who was executed in Caligula's reign. In her younger years, Lepida was betrothed to Claudius, but her parents fell out of favour with Augustus so the emperor broke off the engagement. In AD 8, her mother Julia the Younger( otherwise called Vipsania Julia) was exiled for adultery, like her own mother Julia. Her father Lucius was executed in 14 for participating in a conspiracy against Augustus. By AD 13, Lepida had married Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a member of the patrician branch of the ancient gens Junia. Their children were: The time of her death is not known. She is sometimes said to have been poisoned on the orders of Agrippina the Younger during the reign of Nero, but this Lepida was evidently Domitia Lepida, the mother of Valeria Messalina and the"" second"" wife of Appius Junius Silanus.

Manius Aemilius Lepidus (consul 11)
Manius Aemilius Lepidus was the son or nephew of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger and consul of Rome in 11 AD. Tacitus reports that Augustus on his deathbed, while discussing possible rivals for the Roman Emperor Tiberius, described him as worthy of becoming emperor("" capax imperii""), but"" disdainful"" of supreme power. He defended his sister Aemilia Lepida at her trial in 20 AD. He had a daughter also called Aemilia Lepida. At the trial of Clutorius Priscus, he argued without success that the proposed death sentence was excessively harsh. After 5 BC, but prior to acceding to the consulship, Lepidus was coopted as an Augur. In 21 AD, Tiberius appointed him to the governorship of Asia.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 232 BC)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( died 216 BC) was the Roman consul for 232 BC, and according to Livy served again as"" suffect"" consul, possibly in 221. He also served at one time as augur. He died in 216. It was in Lepidus' honor that the first gladiatorial games("" munera"") were held, on the occasion of his death. He was survived by his three sons; Lucius, Quintus, and Marcus. The latter was most likely the Marcus Aemilius Lepidus who was a Roman consul and Pontifex Maximus in the early 2nd century BC.

Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (son of praetor 56 BC)
Marcus Aemilius Scaurus was the son of Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (Praetor 56 BC) and Mucia Tertia, former wife of Pompey the Great. Sextus Pompey was his half brother.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BC)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 230 – 152 BC) was a twice Roman consul, Pontifex Maximus, Censor and Princeps Senatus. A scion of the ancient Patrician gens Aemilia, he was most likely the son of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, with his brothers being Lucius and Quintus. According to Polybius, Lepidus was"" the handsomest man of his time,"" as well as, in the words of Diodorus, being"" gifted with superior intelligence"". Combining these qualities with an impeccable aristocratic birth, political skill and a reputation for bravery, Lepidus soon rose to become one of the leading Romans of his generation. Lepidus was the great- grandfather of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Triumvir.

"Charles XIII of Sweden
Charles XIII, or Carl XIII,( 7 October 1748 – 5 February 1818), was King of Sweden( as"" Charles XIII"") from 1809 and King of Norway( proclaimed as Charles XIII but in recent times accurately referred to as Charles II) from 1814 to his death. He was the second son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, sister of Frederick the Great. Though known as King Charles XIII in Sweden, he was actually the seventh Swedish king by that name, as Charles IX( reigned 1604 – 1611) had adopted his numeral after studying a fictitious history of Sweden.

Charles VIII of Sweden
Charles VIII of Sweden (1408 Uppsala - 1470 Stockholm, in reality Charles II), Charles I of Norway, also Carl , was king of Sweden (1448–1457, 1464–1465 and from 1467 to his death in 1470) and king of Norway (1449–1450).

Charles Philip, Duke of Södermanland
Prince Charles Philip of Sweden, Duke of Södermanland, (""Swedish: Carl Filip"" ; Alt-Anzen (Vana-Antsla), 22 April 1601 – Narva, 25 January 1622) was a Swedish prince, Duke of Södermanland, Närke and Värmland. Charles Philip was the second surviving son of King Charles IX of Sweden and his second spouse, Duchess Christina of Holstein-Gottorp.

Charles XI of Sweden
Charles XI, also Carl  (24 November 1655 – 5 April 1697 OS) was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611–1718). He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.

Oscar II of Sweden
Oscar II (Oscar Fredrik; 21 January 1829 – 8 December 1907) was the King of Sweden from 1872 until his death, and was also the final King of Norway from the House of Bernadotte. Oscar II was King during a time when both Sweden and Norway were undergoing a period of industrialization and rapid technological progress. His reign also saw the gradual decline of the Union of Sweden and Norway, which culminated in its dissolution in 1905. He was subsequently succeeded as King of Norway by his grandnephew Prince Carl of Denmark under the regnal name Haakon VII, and as King of Sweden by his eldest son, Gustaf V.
Oscar II is the paternal great-great-grandfather of Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden since 1973. Harald V, King of Norway since 1991, is a great-grandson of Oscar II, through his third son Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland.

Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland
Prince Carl of Sweden and Norway, Duke of Västergötland (27 February 1861 – 24 October 1951) was a Swedish prince. Through his daughters, for whom he arranged excellent dynastic marriages, he is an ancestor of several members of European royal houses today, including the reigning monarchs King Harald V of Norway, King Philippe of Belgium, and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg.

God Save the Queen
It is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977, as well as for several of the UK's territories that have their own additional local anthem. It is also the royal anthem -- played specifically in the presence of the monarch -- of all the aforementioned countries, as well as Australia (since 1984), Canada (since 1980), Barbados and Tuvalu. In countries not previously part of the British Empire, the tune of ``God Save the Queen ''has provided the basis for various patriotic songs, though still generally connected with royal ceremony. In the United States, the melody is used for the patriotic song`` My Country, 'Tis of Thee''. The melody is also used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein, ``Oben am jungen Rhein ''.

There are two articles for Canadian band The Poppy Family:

You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch
Jim Carrey sang this song in the 2000 live action film adaptation, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, as the Grinch himself.

Is There Anybody Out There?
The second half of the song is an instrumental classical guitar solo. Interestingly, it is not widely known who played it: In several interviews, David Gilmour has said that he tried to perform it, and was not satisfied with the final result (``I could play it with a leather pick but could n't play it properly fingerstyle ''). Accordingly, session musician Joe DiBlasi was brought in by Michael Kamen to play with the rest of the orchestra. He was ultimately wrongly credited as`` Ron DiBlasi'' on the album sleeve because Roger Waters only remembered that it was a three - letter name; Ron was the closest name he could remember to Joe when creating the record.

Tekle Haymanot of Gondar
Tekle Haymanot was proclaimed Emperor("" nəgusä nägäst"") ( February 1788 – 1789) of Ethiopia by the Emperor Baede Maryam's courtiers. He established his palace in Gondar, and ruled there for around a year. He may be identical with the Emperor"" Haimanot"" mentioned by Henry Salt, who ruled for a year between Iyasu III and Hezqeyas and had died before 1810. Tekle Haymanot of Gondar is sometimes given the title"" Atse"", a less familiar Amharic word for"" Emperor"", to distinguish him from the other Emperors of Ethiopia with the same name. Since he was not recognized as a legitimate ruler, he is not assigned a number.

Tekle Haymanot
Tekle Haymanot or Takla Haymanot ( Ge'ez ተክለ ሃይማኖት"" takla hāymānōt"", modern"" tekle hāymānōt Plant of Faith""; known in the Coptic Church as Saint Takla Haymanot of Ethiopia)( c. 1215 – c. 1313) was an Ethiopian Hermit, monk and"" Lek'e P'ap'as""( Ge'ez Title for the bishop with a higher rank than the other bishops, but a lower rank than the Archbishop or Patriarch) who founded a major monastery in his native province of Shewa. He is significant for being the only Ethiopian saint popular both amongst Ethiopians and outside that country. Tekle Haymanot "" is the only Ethiopian saint celebrated officially in foreign churches such as Rome and Egypt."" His feast day is August 17, and the 24th day of every month in the Ethiopian calendar is dedicated to Tekle Haymanot.

Tekle Haymanot II
Tekle Haymanot II (Ge'ez ተክለ ሃይማኖት, ""Anchor of the faith""; 1754 – 7 September 1777) was ""nəgusä nägäst"" as Admas Sagad III (Ge'ez አድማስ ሰገድ ""to whom the horizon bows""; 18 October 1769 – 13 April 1777) of Ethiopia, and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. He was the son of Yohannes II by ""Woizero"" Sancheviyar, at the Imperial prison of Mount Wehni. The Scots explorer James Bruce (who was in Ethiopia from September 1769 to November 1771) described his appearance as follows:

Hailu Tekle Haymanot
Hailu Tekle Haymanot, KBE( 1868 – 1950), also named Hailu II of Gojjam, was an army commander and a member of the nobility of the Ethiopian Empire. He represented a provincial ruling elite who were often at odds with the Ethiopian central government. Hailu Tekle Haymanot was an independent- minded potentate who, throughout his life, was mistrustful of and mistrusted by the Emperor.

Salomon III
Salomon III or Solomon III was the Emperor of Ethiopia (20 May 1796 – 15 July 1797 and 16 June – 25 July 1799) and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. He was the son of Tekle Haymanot II. He may be identical with the Emperor Solomon whom the traveler Henry Salt lists as one of the Emperors still alive at the time of his visit in 1809/1810. E. A. Wallis Budge notes some authorities believe he was the same person as Baeda Maryam II.

Tekle Haymanot I
Tekle Haymanot I("" Plant of religion,"" throne name Le`al Sagad,"" to whom the exalted bows""),( 28 March 1684 – 30 June 1708) was"" nəgusä nägäst""( 27 March 1706- 30 June 1708) of Ethiopia, and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. He was the son of Iyasu I and Empress Malakotawit. He is often referred to as"" Irgum Tekle Haymanot"" or"" Tekle Haymanot the Cursed"" Tekle Haymanot became Emperor following Iyasus' retirement to an island in Lake Tana. With the support of his mother Empress Malakotawit, some of the officials argued, after the precedent of king Kaleb, that Iyasu had abdicated, and crowned Tekle Haymanot"" nəgusä nägäst"" in Gondar. This act was not embraced by the entire state, and the resulting civil strife led to Iyasu's murder at the order of his son Tekle Haymanot. In September, 1707, a rebel in Gojjam declared himself"" nəgusä nägäst"" under the name Amda Seyon, and made his way to the capital city, where he had himself crowned. Tekle Haymanot quickly returned to Gondar, despite the difficulty of travel during the rainy season, forced the usurper to flee, and celebrated his triumph. Amda Seyon was later killed in battle in Maitsa. However his unpopularity for having ordered the murder of his widely revered father was profound and he never overcame it. The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or"" Era of the Princes""( a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.

Tewodros I
Tewodros I("" Theodore,"" throne name"" Son of the Lion"") was Emperor of Ethiopia( 1413 – 1414) and a member of the House of Solomon. He was the son of Dawit I by Queen Seyon Mangasha.

Hayk
Hayk the Great, or The Great Hayk, also known as Hayk Nahapet( Հայկ Նահապետ,, Hayk the"" head of family"" or patriarch), is the legendary patriarch and founder of the Armenian nation. His story is told in the"" History of Armenia"" attributed to the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene( or Movses Khorenatsi, c. 410- c. 490).

Tekle Giyorgis I
Tekle Giyorgis I (""Plant of Saint George""; c. 1751 – 12 December 1817) was Emperor of Ethiopia (throne name Feqr Sagad) intermittently between 20 July 1779 and June 1800, and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. He was the youngest son of Yohannes II and Woizoro Sancheviyer, and the brother of Tekle Haymanot II. According to Sven Rubenson, who described Tekle Giyorgis as the last emperor to exercise authority on his own, ""It is not without justification that he has in Ethiopian tradition received the nickname ""Fiṣame Mengist"", 'the end of the government'"".

"Eochaid Ailtlethan
Eochaid (or Eochu) Ailtlethan (""broad blade""), son of Ailill Caisfiaclach, was, according to medieval Irish legends and historical traditions, a High King of Ireland. According to the ""Lebor Gabála Érenn"", he took the throne after overthrowing and killing the previous incumbent, Adamair, and ruled for eleven years, until he was killed in battle by Fergus Fortamail. The ""Lebor Gabála Érenn"" synchronises his reign with that of Ptolemy V Epiphanes in Egypt (204–181 BC). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's ""Foras Feasa ar Éirinn"" dates his reign to 285–274 BC, that of the ""Annals of the Four Masters"" (which gives him a reign of seventeen years) to 414–396 BC.

Eochaid mac Áeda Find
Eochaid mac Áeda Find is a spurious King of Dál Riata found in some rare High Medieval king-lists and in older history books. Supposedly a son of Áed Find (died 778) and successor to Áed's brother Fergus mac Echdach, Eochaid is now thought to represent a misplacing of the reign of Eochaid mac Echdach. The reigns of Selbach mac Ferchair, Dúngal mac Selbaig and, perhaps, Alpín mac Echdach, are similarly misplaced in the sources which contain this Eochaid.

Airechtach ua Dunchadh Muirsce
Airechtach ua Dunchadh Muirsce( ???–730) was a king of Ui Fiachrach Muaidhe. Airechtach was a grandson of Dúnchad Muirisci. However, unlike his grandfather, he never became King of Connacht.

Nath Í mac Fiachrach
Nath Í, also known as Dathí, son of Fiachrae, son of Eochaid Mugmedon, was a semi-historical Irish king of the 5th century, the father of the likely-historical king Ailill Molt and the ancestor of the Uí Fiachrach dynasties of early medieval Connacht. According to legend, he was a High King of Ireland, and died after being struck by lightning while on an expedition to the Alps.

Eochu Buadach
Eochu Buadach, son of Dui Ladrach, was, according to some redactions or versions of Lebor Gabála Érenn, a High King of Ireland. But he is not included as a High King in other versions of the story. He was the father of two High Kings of Ireland, Ugaine Mor, and Bodbchad.

Éogan Mór
In Irish traditional history Eógan( or Eoghan Mór—a name also used by his grandfather, Mug Nuadat), eldest son of Ailill Ollamh, was a 2nd or 3rd century AD king of Munster. He is credited with founding or at least giving his name to the Eóganachta, a dynasty which ruled as kings of Munster and later princes of Desmond until the late 16th century. The son of Éogan Mór was Fiachu Muillethan. His mother was Sadb ingen Chuinn, daughter of Conn of the Hundred Battles.

Eochaid Buide
Eochaid Buide was king of Dál Riata from around 608 until 629. "" Buide"" refers to the colour yellow, as in the colour of his hair. He was a younger son of Áedán mac Gabráin and became his father's chosen heir upon the death of his elder brothers. Adomnán's ""Life of Saint Columba"" has Columba foresee that Eochaid, then a child, will succeed his father in preference to his adult brothers Artúr, Eochaid Find and Domangart. In the last two years of his reign, 627–629, Eochaid was apparently co-ruler with Connad Cerr, who predeceased him. Eochaid was followed by his son Domnall Brecc. Eochaid's other sons named by the Senchus fer n-Alban are Conall Crandomna, Failbe (who died at the Battle of Fid Eoin), Cú-cen-máthair (whose death is reported in the Annals of Ulster for 604), Conall Bec, Connad or Conall Cerr (who may be the same person as Connad Cerr who died at Fid Eoin), Failbe, Domangart and Domnall Donn (not the same person as Domnall Donn unless his obituary is misplaced by 45 years like that of Ferchar mac Connaid) According to the ""Fled Dúin na nGéd"", Eochaid Buide was the grandfather of Congal Cáech. The story has anachronistic features as it has Eochaid alive at the time of the battle of Mag Rath (securely dated to within a year of 637), but it is chronologically feasible that Congal Cáech could have been the son of Eochaid's daughter if the identification of Cú-cen-máthair and the dating of his death is correct.

Eógan mac Muiredaig
Eógan mac Muiredaig is named in some Scots sources as a king of Dál Riata, probably in the 730s. Presumed to be the son of Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig, and thus a king of the Cenél Loairn, Eógan is not named in any surviving Irish annals, nor does he appear in the Duan Albanach, which passes from Muiredach to Áed Find. The ""Chronicle of the Kings of Dál Riata"" names Eógan son of Muiredach as king after Muiredach, and the king-list in the Chronicle of Melrose includes him. Later genealogies of the Mormaers of Moray trace their descent from the Cenél Loairn through one Ruadrí, a presumed brother of Eógan's father. Eógan's reign falls in the period when Dál Riata was invaded and conquered by the Picts under Óengus mac Fergusa. The name of his successor is unknown, and the next king to appear in the record is Áed Find of the Cenél nGabráin, some three decades after Eógan's time.

Conchobar mac Nessa
Conchobar mac Nessa (son of Ness) is the king of Ulster in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. He rules from Emain Macha (Navan Fort, near Armagh). He is usually said to be the son of the High King Fachtna Fáthach, although in some stories his father is the druid Cathbad, and he is usually known by his matronymic, ""mac Nessa"": his mother is Ness, daughter of Eochaid Sálbuide, King of Ulster.

Fergus Mór
Fergus Mór mac Eirc (English: Fergus the Great) was a legendary king of Dál Riata. He was the son of Erc of Dalriada. While his historicity may be debatable, his posthumous importance as the founder of Scotland in the national myth of Medieval and Renaissance Scotland is not in doubt. Rulers of Scotland from Cináed mac Ailpín until the present time claim descent from Fergus Mór.

Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn
``Frankly, my dear, I do n't give a damn ''is a line from the 1939 film Gone with the Wind starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. The line is spoken by Rhett Butler (Gable), as his last words to Scarlett O'Hara (Leigh), in response to her tearful question:`` Where shall I go? What shall I do?'' Scarlett clings to the hope that she can win him back. This line is also partially spoken by Rhett Butler in Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone with the Wind, published in 1936, from which the film is derived.

The Better 'Ole (1926 film)
The Better 'Ole is a 1926 American silent World War I comedy drama film. Released by Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., this film is the second full-length film to utilize the Vitaphone sound-on-disc process, two months after the first Vitaphone feature ""Don Juan""; with no audible dialogue, the film does have a synchronized musical score and sound effects. This film was also the second onscreen adaptation of the 1917 musical ""The Better 'Ole"" by Bruce Bairnsfather and Arthur Elliot. Charlie Chaplin's eldest brother Sydney Chaplin played the main lead as Old Bill in perhaps his best-known film today. This film is also believed by many to have the first spoken word of dialog, coffee, although there are those who disagree. At one point during the film, Harold Goodwin's character whispers a word to Sydney Chaplin which is also faintly heard.

When Johnny Comes Marching Home
``When Johnny Comes Marching Home ''was immensely popular and was sung by both sides of the American Civil War. It became a hit in England as well.

"Pareherwenemef
Pareherwenemef (Pre-hir-wonmef, Prehirwenemef, Rehirwenemef) was an ancient Egyptian prince of the 19th dynasty, the third son of Pharaoh Ramesses II, the second by Queen Nefertari.

Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef
Both Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef were sons of a king called Sobekemsaf, most probably Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf (Sobekemsaf II today, not I) based on an inscription from a doorjamb from a 17th Dynasty temple at Gebel Antef. While his own tomb has not been located, it was likely located in the area of Dra' Abu el-Naga' where the pyramid tomb of his brother Nubkheperre Intef was found in 2001. The pyramidion of the pyramid of Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef's pyramid was found in Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It has a slope of 60 degrees and is inscribed with this king's names. The pyramidion is now in the British Museum (BM EA 478).

Kekheretnebti
Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30–35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.

Isetnofret (daughter of Khaemwaset)
Isetnofret was an Ancient Egyptian woman and daughter of the high priest of Ptah and king's son Khaemweset( lived around 1200 BC). She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called"" daughter of his body"". On a relief found at Saqqara she is called"" his beloved daughter"" and"" king's daughter"". Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the"" noble woman"" Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.

Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit
Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit are two small princesses who appear in scenes dating to the later part of the reign of Akhenaten. The titles of at least one of the princess is of the form ""[...-ta]sherit, born of [...], born of the King's Great Wife [...]. The inscription is damaged and the name of the mother and grandmother of the princesses has not been preserved. Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit has been known to archaeologists since 1938, when a talatat block with her picture and name was found in Hermopolis.

Neserkauhor
Neserkauhor was an Ancient Egyptian prince, son of pharaoh Djedkare Isesi, during the second half of Fifth Dynasty. Neserkauhor was buried in Abusir, in an area known today as ""Djedkare's family cemetery"".

Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit
Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit (or Ankhesenpaaten-ta-sherit, “Ankhesenpaaten the Younger”) was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit are two small princesses who appear in scenes dating to the later part of the reign of Akhenaten. The titles of at least one of the princess is of the form ""[... -ta]sherit, born of , born of the King's Great Wife . The inscription is damaged and the name of the mother and grandmother of the princesses has not been preserved. Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit has been known to archaeologists since 1938, when a talatat block with her picture and name was found in Hermopolis.

Mereret (12th Dynasty)
Mereret (or Meret) was an Ancient Egyptian ""King's Daughter"" known from her burial next to the Pyramid of Pharaoh Senusret III (ruled about 1878 BC to 1839 BC) at Dahshur. On the north side of the king's pyramid was a row of four pyramids belonging to the king's wives. These pyramids were connected by an underground gallery. On the west side of the gallery were further burials arranged for women with the title ""king's daughter"". They were buried in sarcophagi that were placed into niches. All burials were found looted. However, the robbers missed two boxes filled with personal adornments found in 1894 by Jacques de Morgan. One of these boxes must have belonged to a ""king's daughter"" Sithathor, the other box to a ""king's daughter"" with the name Mereret or Meret. Not much else is known about Mereret. Her name, with different spellings, appears on several scarab seals found in the jewellery box. Here, she always bears the title ""King's Daughter"". From the position of her burial it might be concluded that she was the daughter of King Senusret III. Among her personal adornments were also pieces with the name of King Amenemhet III, indicating that she might have died under that king (who was most likely her brother).

Tisethor
Tisethor( named after the god Horus) was a princess of ancient Egypt, a daughter of Princess Kekheretnebti and granddaughter of the King Djedkare Isesi. Her father is not known. She was a niece of Neserkauhor, Meret- Isesi and Isesi-ankh. She barely reached the age of puberty when she died. She was buried in the mastaba of her mother.

Amenhotep (High Priest of Amun)
Amenhotep was the High Priest of Amun towards the end of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt, serving under Ramesses IX, Ramesses X and Ramesses XI. He was the son of Ramessesnakht, the previous high priest of Amun. It is not beyond dispute who succeeded him in office. For a long time it was assumed that he was followed by the High Priest Herihor. However, Karl Jansen- Winkeln has suggested that Amenhotep was instead succeeded by the High Priest Piankh. We know the names of several of his brothers and a sister: -his( eldest?) brother, the prophet of Amun Meribast II -his brother, the Chief Steward Usimarenakth II -his sister Aatmeret I -his brother, the Second Prophet of Amun Nesamun I( see below) Unfortunately, there is no hard evidence concerning the identity of his wife( wives?). Recently it has been proposed that he may have been married to Hrere, but at the moment this remains highly speculative.

He returned with the supernatural thriller End of Days (1999), later followed by the action films The 6th Day (2000) and Collateral Damage (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which went on to earn over $150 million domestically.

Mexican Spanish
Spanish was brought to Mexico in the 16th century. As in all other Spanish - speaking countries (including Spain), different accents and varieties of the language exist in different parts of the country, for both historical and sociological reasons. Among these, the varieties that are best known outside of the country are those of central Mexico -- both educated and uneducated varieties -- largely because the capital, Mexico City, hosts most of the mass communication media with international projection. For this reason, most of the film dubbing identified abroad with the label ``Mexican Spanish ''or`` Latin American Spanish'' actually corresponds to the central Mexican variety.

Beorhtweald Ealdorman of Kent was an English ruler of the 9th century AD. His father was Burgred of Mercia, his mother: Æthelswith, and his brother: Beorhtnoð æthling of Kent.

Æthelflæd, known as Æthelflæd of Damerham to distinguish her from other women of the same name, was the second wife of King Edmund I of England.

Ælfflæd was married to Byrhtnoth, who probably succeeded her father as ealdorman of Essex. Byrhtnoth was killed at the Battle of Maldon in 991. Æthelflæd and Ælfflæd were Ælfgar's heirs at his death, some time between 946 and 951 based on the dating of his will, S1483. Æthelflæd married Edmund in 944 following the death of his first wife Ælfgifu, mother of the future kings Eadwig and Edgar. She and Edmund are not known to have had any children, and Edmund was killed in 946, leaving Æthelflæd as a wealthy widow. Records of Ely Cathedral, to which she, her sister, and her brother-in-law, were generous benefactors, say that she then married an ealdorman named Æthelstan. There were several ealdormen of that name active in the reign of Edmund's brother and successor Eadred, and it most likely that Æthelflæd married the man known as Æthelstan Rota, although she could have married Æthelstan Half-King. Æthelflæd's will survives, S1494, and her will, and thus her death, is dated to between 962, and more probably 975, and 991. In addition to gifts to Ely, the will endowed Glastonbury, Canterbury, Bury, and the family monastery of Stoke-by-Nayland.

Steven Spielberg
Spielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for Schindler's List (1993) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). Three of Spielberg's films—Jaws (1975), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and Jurassic Park (1993)—achieved box office records, originated and came to epitomize the blockbuster film. The unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $9 billion worldwide, making him the highest-grossing director in history. His personal net worth is estimated to be more than $3 billion. He has been associated with composer John Williams since 1974, who composed music for all save five of Spielberg's feature films.

Steven Spielberg
Rejecting offers to direct Jaws 2, King Kong and Superman, Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about UFOs, which became Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, Close Encounters was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other Academy Awards nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, Vilmos Zsigmond, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, 1941, a big-budgeted World War II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4 million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.

She was a daughter of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and from 1173 High Duke of Poland, by his first wife, Elisabeth, daughter of King Béla II of Hungary. Elisabeth's birthdate is unknown. Medieval sources do not even indicate whether the Hungarian princess was her mother. Elizabeth is believed to have been her daughter only because both had the same name. Some scholars report that Elizabeth was born about 1152 or 1154.

Elisabeth of Moravia
Elizabeth of Moravia (German: ""Elisabeth von Mähren"", Czech: ""Alžběta Moravská"", Upper Sorbian: ""Hilžbjeta Morawska"", c. 1355 – 20 November 1400) was the second daughter and third issue of John Henry of Moravia, (grandson of Přemysl II, Otakar, King of Bohemia) and his second wife Margaret of Opava. She became Margravine consort of Meissen by her marriage to William I, Margrave of Meissen (1366). Elizabeth was buried in Prince's Chapel of St. John and St. Donatus Cathedral of Meissen.

Elisabeth of Bohemia (1358–1373)
Elisabeth of Bohemia( 1358–1373) was the daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Anne of Schweidnitz. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Elisabeth of Bohemia( 1292–1330). She had a brother, Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, and one half sister, Katharine of Bohemia, whose mother was Blanche of Valois who was Charles IV's previous wife. Elisabeth had another half sister who was the daughter of Blanche, Margaret of Bohemia but she died in 1349, so Elisabeth never knew her. After the death of her mother, Charles remarried for the last time to Elizabeth of Pomerania. Elisabeth gained six half- siblings from the marriage: Anna, Queen of England, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, Margaret"" the younger"" of Bohemia, John of Görlitz, Charles, and Henry. Elisabeth married when she was only eight in 1366 to Albert III, Duke of Austria. Elisabeth and Albert had no children and she died aged only fifteen in 1373; she was buried with Albert's parents in Gaming Charterhouse in Lower Austria. Her husband remarried to Beatrix of Nuremberg and they were parents of Albert IV, Duke of Austria.

Elizabeth of Slavonia
Elizabeth of Slavonia( 1352 – before 1380), member of the Hungarian branch of the Capetian House of Anjou, was the heir presumptive to the Hungarian throne between 1360 and 1370. Elizabeth was the only daughter of Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, a younger son of the Hungarian king Charles I. Her mother was Margaret of Bavaria, and her only known sibling John, Duke of Slavonia( 1354 – 1360). Elizabeth was regarded as heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary after the death of her brother, as her uncle Louis I had no children. Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, wanted her to marry his eldest son, Wenceslaus. However, the marriage negotiations were ended in 1370, when a daughter named Catherine was born to Elizabeth's uncle. Catherine was followed by two sisters, which meant that Elizabeth would not inherit the Holy Crown of Hungary. In October 1370, Elizabeth married Philip II, Prince of Taranto, a 41- year- old widower and pretender to the Latin Empire. Philip had survived his children by his previous marriage and was in need of heirs. As her dower, Elizabeth was granted Corfu as a personal fief. Their only known child, a son named Philip, was born in 1371 and died the same year. Elizabeth was widowed on 25 November 1374. She appears to have died before the end of the 1380s.

She was the only daughter of Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo and his wife, whose name and origins are unknown; her brother, Władysław the White, was later a candidate for the Polish throne. By 1323, King Charles I of Hungary wanted to increase influence over Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia. He offered Stephan the hand of Elizabeth, the relative of his own Piast wife Elizabeth. By marrying Elizabeth of Kuyavia, Stephen received from Charles the lands to the west formerly held by Mladen I Šubić of Bribir and Usora and Soli in the north formerly held by Vladislav, King of Syrmia. The marriage was celebrated by 1339. Up to 1339, Stephan was married to an unknown Bulgarian princess. The only child which can be attributed to Elizabeth of Kuyavia without doubt is Elizabeth of Bosnia, born c. 1340. Some believe that Catherine of Bosnia, Countess of Cilli, was daughter of Elizabeth of Kuyavia and Stephen II, while others argue that Catherine was daughter of Stephen II's brother Vladislaus and his wife Jelena Šubić. Elizabeth may have also had a son, Vuk who may have survived infancy but he did not outlive his father so never became Ban of Bosnia. Vuk may have been the son of one of Stephen's previous two wives. Stephen outlived Elizabeth. It is unknown what Elizabeth died of. Judging by the time, it is possible that she died of Black Death, which was sweeping across Europe during the 14th century. Banness Elizabeth was buried in Bobovac in a tomb which she shared with her husband, brother- in- law Vladislaus and sister- in- law Jelena. After Elizabeth of Kuyavia's death, her daughter Elizabeth was fostered by the Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth and this soon led to Elizabeth's marriage to Louis I of Hungary.

David Richard Fliehr( born March 6, 1979), better known by his ring name David Flair, is an American retired professional wrestler best known for his time in World Championship Wrestling( WCW), where he held the United States and World Tag Team championships. He is the son of former wrestling world champion Ric Flair and the older half brother of Charlotte Flair and Reid Flair.

Reid Flair
Richard Reid Fliehr( February 26, 1988 March 29, 2013), better known by his ring name Reid Flair, was an American professional wrestler. He was the youngest son of retired professional wrestler Ric Flair, younger half- brother of wrestler David Flair, and younger brother of Charlotte Flair.

Ric Flair
Flair triumphantly returned to WCW as a hero in February 1993, as a result of a ``no - compete ''clause he was unable to wrestle, so he hosted a short - lived talk show in WCW called A Flair for the Gold. Arn Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show's set, and Flair's maid Fifi cleaned or bore gifts. Once he returned to action, Flair briefly held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a tenth time after defeating Barry Windham at Beach Blast before WCW finally left the NWA in September 1993. At Fall Brawl, Flair lost the title, now rebranded the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, to`` Ravishing Rick'' Rude. At Starrcade in 1993, Flair defeated Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight title for the second time. In the spring of 1994, Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival Ricky Steamboat and challenged Steamboat to a match at Spring Stampede which ended in a no contest from a double pin, causing the title to be held up. Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held - up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night. The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win. Flair then challenged Col. Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree, which turned out to be Barry Windham, whom Flair defeated, afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager. He would also wrestle Lord Steven Regal in a five - match series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which aired on WCW Worldwide between April 30 and May 28, in which Flair won the series, with 2 wins, 1 loss, and 2 draws.

Half Mile Lagoon once covered an area of 36000 square metres, however the largest of the remaining pools was only approximately 100 square metres( when surveyed in 2005). This area is an example of decreasing water levels which have impacted on many of the smaller dune lakes on the Aupouri Pensinsula. Half Mile Lagoon lies directly adjacent to the Aupouri pine forest, and much of the catchment land use is pastoral.

Lake Waitaki
Lake Waitaki is the smallest, oldest and farthest downstream of the three man-made lakes of the Waitaki hydroelectric project in New Zealand's South Island. It lies below lakes Aviemore and Benmore on the Waitaki River, close to the town of Kurow. It is part of the traditional boundary of the Canterbury and Otago regions( although the official border has been moved southward to include the entire lake, as well as the entire northwest portion of Waitaki District within the Canterbury Region. The lake is created by Waitaki Dam, a 36 m high spill weir dam built between 1928 and 1934. The Waitaki power station has an installed capacity of 105 MW. Waitaki was the last dam built in New Zealand with excavation done with pick and shovel, not heavy machinery. The power station is to be upgraded by Meridian Energy between 2011 and 2016 at a projected cost of$ NZ 60- 80 million.

He married Euphemia, daughter of Sir Adam de Crosebi or Crosbj of Albemarle( b c1098), and Cecily FitzDuncan( b c 1113).

Goli Soda
Baradwaj Rangan wrote ""The signature achievement of ""Goli Soda"" is its ruthless unmasking of how hollow most of our masala movies are, and how, with a little imagination, just a little, you can make a film which does not insult the audience"" and went on to state, ""I will be very surprised if there's a more entertaining, more inventive, more well-acted masala movie this year"". The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity"". Cinemalead.com rated it with 4/5 stars and said ""Overall if you prefer to watch a gutsy film which is different and unique from the routine Tamil cinema, go and watch Goli Soda which surely deserves a repeated viewing"".

He was a younger son of Sancho III of Navarre and Muniadona of Castile, and by his father's will recognised the supremacy of his eldest brother, García Sánchez III of Navarre. While Ferdinand inaugurated the rule of the Navarrese Jiménez dynasty over western Spain, his rise to preeminence among the Christian rulers of the peninsula shifted the locus of power and culture westward after more than a century of Leonese decline.

Karen Gillan as Nebula: An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings and is a loyal lieutenant in the employ of Ronan and Thanos. About the character, Gillan said, ``She is the female villain of the film... She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason. ''She also added,`` I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of sibling rivalry. That's the most interesting aspect to me, because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly. And she's a total sadist, so that's fun too.''

The Review of Reviews was a noted family of monthly journals founded in 1890-1893 by British reform journalist William Thomas Stead (1849–1912).

Clothing
By the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European colonialism. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. Fast fashion clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated used clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.

Culture
In the United States, ""Cultural Studies"" focuses largely on the study of popular culture, that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS. It has since become strongly associated with Stuart Hall, who succeeded Hoggart as Director. Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as ""Western Civilization"" or as ""Globalism.""

Elizabeth Tudor (disambiguation)
Elizabeth Tudor was Queen Elizabeth I of England. Elizabeth Tudor may also refer to:

Elizabeth Woodville
Now referred to as Dame Elizabeth Grey, she and the Duke of Buckingham (a former close ally of Richard III and now probably seeking the throne for himself) now allied themselves with Lady Margaret Stanley (née Beaufort) and espoused the cause of Margaret's son Henry Tudor, a great-great-great-grandson of King Edward III, the closest male heir of the Lancastrian claim to the throne with any degree of validity. To strengthen his claim and unite the two feuding noble houses, Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort agreed that the latter's son should marry the former's eldest daughter, Elizabeth of York, who upon the death of her brothers became the heiress of the House of York. Henry Tudor agreed to this plan and in December 1483 publicly swore an oath to that effect in the cathedral in Rennes, France. A month earlier, an uprising in his favour, led by Buckingham, had been crushed.

Anne of York (daughter of Edward IV)
Anne of York (2 November 1475 – 23 November 1511) was born in the Palace of Westminster, London, as the fifth daughter of King Edward IV of England and his wife, Elizabeth Woodville. She was First Lady of the Bedchamber to the queen in 1487-1494.

English Renaissance
The English theatre scene, which performed both for the court and nobility in private performances, and a very wide public in the theatres, was the most crowded in Europe, with a host of other playwrights as well as the giant figures of Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Elizabeth herself was a product of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham, and wrote occasional poems such as On Monsieur's Departure at critical moments of her life. Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon. All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated, as was much of the nobility, and Italian literature had a considerable following, providing the sources for many of Shakespeare's plays. English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method, a forerunner of the Scientific Method. The language of the Book of Common Prayer, first published in 1549, and at the end of the period the Authorised Version (``King James Version ''to Americans) of the Bible (1611) had enduring impacts on the English consciousness.

Elizabeth I of England

The Belle of New York (1952 film)
The Belle of New York is a 1952 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Hollywood musical comedy film set in New York circa 1900 and stars Fred Astaire, Vera-Ellen, Alice Pearce, Marjorie Main, Gale Robbins and Keenan Wynn, with music by Harry Warren and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The film was directed by Charles Walters. This whimsical (even by Astaire's standards) musical failed at the box office and impressed few critics at the time, mainly due to the nature of the plot which empowers lovers to float free of the influence of gravity - a conceit reprised in the 1999 film ""Simply Irresistible"". Astaire was reluctant to take the project - he was originally supposed to play the role in 1946 but had avoided it through retirement. Clearly stung by its failure, Astaire later claimed that the dance routines - of which there are more than usual - are of a particularly high standard - a rare verdict from such a notoriously self-critical artist. Vera-Ellen is generally viewed as one of Astaire's most technically proficient dance partners, and this was a factor in his readiness to expand the dance content of the film beyond its traditional proportions.

"Grimoald the Elder
Grimoald I( 616–657), called the Elder( in French,"" Grimaud l' Ainé""), was the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia from 640 to 656. He was the son of Pepin of Landen and Itta.

Grimoald the Younger
Grimoald II( died 714), called the Younger, was the mayor of the palace of Neustria from 695. He was the second son of Pepin of Herstal and Plectrude and his father placed him in the office of mayor of the palace in the Neustrian kingdom in 695, when he was still young. He married Theudesinda( or Theodelinda), daughter of Radbod, King of the Frisians, and had two sons: Theudoald and Arnold. While en route to visit the tomb of Saint Lambert at Liège, he was assassinated by a certain Rangar, in the employ of his father- in- law. His sons carried on a fight to be recognised as Pepin of Herstal's true heirs, since Grimoald predeceased his father and his half- brother Charles Martel usurped the lands and offices of their father. In short, he was innocent but unlucky.

Orodreth
In the published version of ""The Silmarillion"", Orodreth () was an Elf of the First Age, the second son of Finarfin (with Finrod Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel being his siblings), and a ruler of Nargothrond.

Finarfin
Finarfin was the third son and youngest child of Finwë. Finarfin's mother was Finwë's second wife Indis. Fëanor was his half-brother and Fingolfin his full brother. His sisters were Findis and Irimë. He married Eärwen, princess of the Teleri. He had four children: Finrod Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor and Galadriel. Orodreth appears as one of Finarfin's sons in the published ""Silmarillion""; in Tolkien's later writings however he clearly is Angrod's son. Christopher Tolkien used an older version of the genealogy in the ""Silmarillion"", but later described this as a mistake. Finarfin was said to be the fairest and wisest of Finwë's sons. Like all of Finwë's sons, Finarfin founded his own house. Uniquely among the Noldor he and his descendants all had golden hair inherited from his mother, so his house was sometimes called ""The Golden House of Finarfin"".

Thorolf Kveldulfsson
Thorolf Kveldulfsson was the oldest son of Kveldulf Bjalfasson and brother of the Norwegian/ Icelandic goði and skald Skalla- Grimr. His ancestor( great uncle) Hallbjorn was nicknamed"" halftroll"", possibly indicating Norwegian- Sami ancestry. He served as a retainer of Harald I of Norway( Harald Fairhair). Thorolf is a hero of the early part of"" Egils saga"".

List of The Hobbit characters
Fili, who with his brother Kili was the youngest dwarf in the company and therefore useful for his keen eyesight. He wore a blue hood and grew a yellow beard.

Thrasimund I of Spoleto
Thrasimund I or Transamund I was the Count of Capua and then Duke of Spoleto( 663 – 703 AD), a faithful follower of Grimoald I of Benevento. Thrasimund assisted Grimoald in usurping the kingship of the Lombards. In return, Grimoald gave him his daughter in marriage and granted him the duchy of Spoleto after the death of Atto. Thrasimund co-ruled with his brother Wachilapus and was succeeded by his son Faroald II after a reign of forty years.

Theudoald
Theudoald( or Theodald; c. 708 – 741) was the mayor of the palace, briefly unopposed in 714 after the death of his grandfather, Pepin of Herstal. Then in 715 the nobility acclaimed Ragenfrid mayor of Neustria and Charles Martel mayor of Austrasia. Theudoald was the legitimate but later claimed illegitimate son of Grimoald II( son of Pepin II of Herstal and Plectrude) and Theudesinda of Frisia( daughter of king Radbod). Thus, he was a grandson of the Frisian king. His grandmother Plectrude tried to have him recognised by his grandfather as the legitimate heir to all the Pippinid lands, instead of Charles Martel. His grandmother surrendered on his behalf in 716 to Chilperic II of Neustria and Ragenfrid. Theudoald died, probably killed, around 741, after the death of his uncle and protector, Charles Martel. It is notable that, despite his having been proclaimed heir to Pepin of Herstal, when Charles Martel seized power, he allowed his nephew to live, instead of killing him, as was often the case in the Middle Ages.

Thiadsvind
Thiadsvind also known as Theudesinda or Theodelinda( 677-?) was the daughter of Redbad, King of the Frisians. In 711 she was married to Grimoald the Younger the eldest son of Pepin of Herstal. The marriage was officiated by archbishop or bishop of the Frisians Willibrord. They had two sons: Theudoald and Arnold.

There are two articles for Canadian band The Poppy Family:

Renegades (band)
Renegades were a British rock band which started out as a side- project from two members of the band Feeder, featuring guitarist Grant Nicholas and bassist Taka Hirose, before becoming a pseudonym name for Feeder themselves. Nicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother, who completed the group and a four- track EP was then recorded. Soon later, Renegades became an alternative name for Feeder at various concerts where they would play an entire show pretending not to be Feeder, but a different band with the same members. If Feeder songs released before the"" Renegades"" album were to be played, the band would announce that they're covering Feeder songs. Grant Nicholas once introduced"" Tangerine"" as"" A cover of a song from a band we know"". The idea was created when Feeder parted company with drummer Mark Richardson who returned to his previous band Skunk Anansie. Brazil was initially contracted with the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university events, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was however recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before the idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the' Renegades' project. The tracks originally intended for the side- project were soon used for the seventh Feeder album"" Renegades"". The side- project was as a result used as a method to promote the"" Renegades"" album at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder. On the first of January 2010, a four- day countdown timer was added to the band's official website. As the countdown was completed on 6 January 2010, the title- track for the EP,"" Renegades"" was released as a free download as well as a package containing the limited edition EP, Renegades shirt, badge set and an e-ticket for one of the six shows available. The"" Renegades EP"" was the first release on the band's own record label, before being followed- up by a second EP. Feeder also used the Renegades name for their Sonisphere 2010 appearance, which was their last UK show using this name and also their tour of Japan in July of the same year. The track"" Renegades"" was re-released, but this time as a Feeder single instead of Renegades and was also on vinyl and download only.

All Time Low
In mid-February 2017, the band announced a new song to be premiered on BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Nick Grimshaw, called ``Dirty Laundry ''. The music video was directed by Pat Tracy, who had also directed the music video for`` Missing You''. This was the first release after changing record labels from Hopeless Records to Fueled by Ramen. Both songs are singles from their album, Last Young Renegade, which was released on June 2, 2017. The band also released their cover of ``Longview ''by Green Day for the documentary`` Green Day: The Early Years''.

"Nebetah
Nebetah was one of the daughters of Ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III of the 18th dynasty and his Great Royal Wife Tiye. She was a younger sister of Akhenaten.

Nebet (queen)
Nebet was an Egyptian Queen, the wife of King Unas. She lived during the time of the Fifth dynasty of Egypt. She is held the mother of the Crown Prince Unas-ankh, though this fact is disputed. In addition to Unas Anch, Nebet may also be the mother of Khentkaues, Neferut, and Nefertkaues.

Nefertiabet
Nefertiabet (""nfr.t ỉ3b.tBeautiful One of the East"") was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 4th dynasty. She was possibly a daughter of Pharaoh Khufu.

Nebettawy

Manasseh (tribal patriarch)
Manasseh or Menashe (""Manaṯ"") was, according to the Book of Genesis, the first son of Joseph and Asenath . Asenath was an Egyptian woman whom Pharaoh gave to Joseph as wife, and the daughter of Potipherah, a priest of On . Manasseh was born in Egypt before the arrival of the children of Israel from Canaan .

Mary, mother of Jesus
According to the writer of Luke, Mary was a relative of Elizabeth, wife of the priest Zechariah of the priestly division of Abijah, who was herself part of the lineage of Aaron and so of the tribe of Levi.[Luke 1:5;1:36] Some of those who consider that the relationship with Elizabeth was on the maternal side, consider that Mary, like Joseph, to whom she was betrothed, was of the House of David and so of the Tribe of Judah, and that the genealogy of Jesus presented in Luke 3 from Nathan, third son of David and Bathsheba, is in fact the genealogy of Mary,[need quotation to verify] while the genealogy from Solomon given in Matthew 1 is that of Joseph. (Aaron's wife Elisheba was of the tribe of Judah, so all their descendants are from both Levi and Judah.)[Num.1:7 & Ex.6:23]

Nahshon
Owing to his direct descent from Judah and to his being the progenitor of so many kings, Nahshon is extolled by the rabbis as a most noble man. Nahshon's sister Elisheba married Aaron, and this is especially mentioned as a hint that one should take care to select a wife whose brothers are noble.

Sebat (king's daughter)
Sebat was an Ancient Egyptian king's daughter of the Twelfth Dynasty. Her only known title is"" king's daughter of his body"".

The inscription mentions at the top Amenemhat II and in a lower register Senusret I, the king's daughter Sebat, the king's wife Neferu, Amenemhat I and again Senusret I. From this evidence it seems clear that Sebat was the daughter of Senusret I and Neferu and the sister of Amenemhat II.

Nebetiunet
Nebetiunet (“Lady of Dendera”; a title of the goddess Hathor) was a princess of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt, a daughter of Pharaoh Thutmose III and his Great Royal Wife Merytre-Hatshepsut.

"Álvaro of Lencastre, 3rd Duke of Aveiro
Álvaro of Lencastre( 1540 – 1626) was the son of Afonso of Lencastre, second son of infante George of Lencastre, 2nd Duke of Coimbra.

George of Lencastre, 1st Duke of Torres Novas
Jorge de Lencastre, or George of Lencastre( Azeitão, 1594 – Lisbon, 1632) was the older son of Dom Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre, 3rd Dukes of Aveiro. As heir of the Dukes of Aveiro, he was 3rd Marquis of Torres Novas and, due to King Philip I ’s special grant, he also became the 1st Duke of Torres Novas. However, he never inherited the Dukedom of Aveiro, once he died before his mother. He married twice:

George of Lencastre, 2nd Duke of Aveiro
Jorge de Lencastre, or George of Lencastre (1548–1578), was the older son of Dom John of Lencastre, 1st Duke of Aveiro and of his wife Juliana de Lara, daughter of the 3rd Marquis of Vila Real. Until his father's death, he used the title of Marquis of Torres Novas, and also succeeded him as 2nd Duke of Aveiro in 1571. He was a close adviser to King Sebastian I of Portugal and he escorted him, both to the Guadalupe interview (where Sebastian met his uncle, King Philip II of Spain) and to the Portuguese campaign to Morocco. George was killed in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, together with the King, in 1578. Before, he had married Madalena Girón, sister of the Spanish 1st Duke of Ossuna, from whom he had a single daughter:

Peter of Lencastre, 5th Duke of Aveiro
Pedro de Lencastre, or Peter of Lencastre( Azeitão, 1608 – Lisbon, 1673), was the youngest son of Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre, 3rd Dukes of Aveiro. He studied theology in the University of Coimbra and he became successively Bishop of Guarda, Archbishop of Évora and Archbishop of Braga. In spite of the Portuguese revolution against the Spanish Habsburgs, his nephew, Raimundo of Lencastre, 4th Duke of Aveiro actively supported the rights of the Habsburg Kings and, in 1663, the new King of the Braganza Dynasty, John IV, decided to confiscate the Dukedom. However, Peter of Lencastre, a Braganza supporter, requested the cancellation of this decision and, finally in 1668, he was recognised as 5th Duke of Aveiro and Marquis of Torres Novas. Later the same year, when the peace between Portugal and Spain was signed, Peter's niece, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, sister and heir of the 4th Duke, requested the cancellation of the decision that granted the Dukedom of Aveiro to her uncle, in order to obtain it for herself. Due to Peter of Lencastre's death in 1673, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, still living in Spain, was recognised as the new Duchess of Aveiro on condition she would return to Portugal.

Gabriel of Lencastre, 7th Duke of Aveiro
His full name was Gabriel de Lencastre Ponce de León Manrique de Lara Cádenas Girón y Aragon( 1667 – 1745), known as"" Dom"" Gabriel of Lencastre. He was the 2nd son of Manuel Ponce de León, 6th Duke of Los Arcos, in Spain, and Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, 6th Duchess of Aveiro. His mother was recognised by the Portuguese King, as Duchess of Aveiro, in 1679, on the condition she would return to Portugal. Due to her husband's opposition, she divorced him, returned to her homeland and regained the House of Aveiro and their estates. Their elder son, Don Joaquín, would inherited the Spanish House of the Dukes of Los Arcos, while the younger, Dom Gabriel, would inherited the Portuguese House of the Dukes of Aveiro. Only after his mother's death( 1715), he came to Portugal. While he lived in Spain, King Charles II granted him the title of Duke of Baños, and he served in the Spanish army, both in the Catalonia and in the Flanders campaigns. He died single without issue. After his death the Duchy was claimed by his nephew, António de Lencastre Ponce de León( son of Joaquin 7th Duke of Los Arcos), and by José de Mascarenhas, 8th Count of Santa Cruz and 5th Marquis of Gouveia( descending from Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre through female line).

Afonso of Lencastre
Afonso of Lencastre( 1597 – 1654), was a Portuguese nobleman, son of the 3rd Dukes of Aveiro, Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre. This family descended from the Infante George of Lencastre, therefore they had royal blood. By a royal decree dated from 8 April 1627, King Philip III of Portugal( aka Philip IV of Spain) granted him the new title of Marquis of Porto Seguro. In spite of the Portuguese revolution of 1 December 1640, Afonso remained faithful to the Spanish Habsburgs. To reward his fidelity, King Philip IV granted him, by a decree issued on 23 March 1642, the new titles of Duke of Abrantes and Marquis of Sardoal. However, as Philip IV was no longer King of Portugal, these two titles were never recognise by the Portuguese authorities. D. Afonso was born in his family palace, in Azeitão( near Setúbal), Portugal, and, on 15 July 1627, he married a Spanish lady, Ana de Sande de Padilla, 2nd Marchioness of Valdefuentes. They had 4 children:

Raimundo of Lencastre, 4th Duke of Aveiro
"" Dom"" Raimundo of Lencastre(? – Cadiz, 1666) was the older son of George of Lencastre, 1st Duke of Torres Novas, and grandson of Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre, 3rd Dukes of Aveiro. Once his father died before his grandmother, in 1632, he succeed him as heir of the House of Aveiro, as 4th Marquis of Torres Novas and 2nd Duke of Torres Novas. He also became 4th Duke of Aveiro when his grandmother, the 3rd Duchess, died in 1636. When the Braganzas expelled the Habsburgs from the Portuguese throne, in 1640, he was nominee member of the Portuguese State Council. However, after 1659, he fled to Brest, in Brittany, and from there he travelled to Spain, where he supported the Spanish Habsburgs rights to the throne of Portugal. He was quite welcomed in Madrid by King Philip IV of Spain, who granted him the new Spanish title of Duke of Ciudad Real, but, in spite his mother and sister also lived in Madrid, he did n't feel comfortable among the conservative Spanish nobility. Meanwhile, in Portugal, Dom Raimundo of Lencastre was condemn for treason( in 1663) and the King of Portugal, John IV, confiscated the Dukedom and granted it to Raimundo's uncle, Peter of Lencastre, a Braganza supporter, who was recognised as 5th Duke of Aveiro and 5th Marquis of Torres Novas. In 1665, the Spanish tried a last effort to conquer Portugal and"" Dom"" Raimundo advised a simultaneous naval expedition, leaving from Cadiz, against the Portuguese cost, which he led. The expedition was not successful and Raimundo died in Cadiz in 1666. He had married Louise Claire of Ligne( 1640 – 1684), daughter of Claude- Lamoral, 3rd Prince of Ligne. They had no issue. Raimundo had three natural children:

João de Lencastre, 1st Duke of Aveiro
João de Lencastre (?, 1501 – Coimbra, 1571), was the older son of Infante George, Duke of Coimbra and of his wife ""Dona"" Beatriz of Vilhena. Through his father, John was a grandchild of King John II of Portugal and a 3rd cousin to King Manuel I of Portugal. Through his mother, daughter of Álvaro of Braganza (4th male son of Fernando I, 2nd Duke of Braganza), John of Lencastre was close related to the most prestigious aristocratic families of the Kingdom (namely the Duke of Braganza, the Marquis of Ferreira, the Marquis of Vila Real, the Count of Vimioso, the Count of Portalegre). When he was 12 years old, he served crown prince John (who became later King John III of Portugal) and King Manuel I granted him the title of Marquis of Torres Novas by a royal decree issued on March 27, 1520. In that time, the royal house announced the marriage of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Guarda (King Manuel I younger son) to the richest and prestigious heir ""Dona"" Guiomar Coutinho, 5th Countess of Marialva and the 3rd Countess of Loulé. However, John of Lencastre declared he had secretly married the richest bride. The scandal in the Court ended when King John III ordered the Marquis imprisonment in the Castle of São Jorge, in Lisbon, allowing the celebration of the Infante Ferdinand's marriage. After nine years, when he was released, he went to live in Setúbal, maybe ashamed for the situation, and he only returned to the Court in 1535, to escort Infante Luis, Duke of Beja, who was leading the Portuguese fleet in Charles V’s crusade against Tunis. In that year King John III granted him the title of Duke of Aveiro. After his return from Madrid, in 1537 (where he was sent by King John III to present formal condolences to Charles V, when his wife, Empress Isabel of Portugal, died) John of Lencastre, 1st Duke of Aveiro, decided to marry to ""Dona"" Juliana de Lara, daughter of the 3rd Marquis of Vila Real. In 1552, he was again chosen by the King to escort, from the border to Lisbon, the Infanta Joan of Spain, who would marry John, Crown Prince of Portugal (John III only surviving son).

Neoclassical architecture
A second neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the Napoleonic Empire.

Romanticism
The period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. Margaret Drabble described it in literature as taking place ``roughly between 1770 and 1848 '', and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, M.H. Abrams placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics. Others have proposed 1780 -- 1830. In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; musical Romanticism, for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss are described stylistically as`` Late Romantic'' and were composed in 1946 -- 48. However, in most fields the Romantic Period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier.

Both George and his younger brother, Richard( Dick), were prodigiously gifted mathematicians and draughtsmen. Grenfell- Baines left a secure, but limiting, job in the Lancashire County Architect's Office to work for the prestigious private firm of Bradshaw Gass& Hope in Bolton in 1930. During the 1930s, Grenfell- Baines became aware of Modernism, particularly the work of Le Corbusier and Gropius, through the architectural press and was determined to practise it himself. He studied at Manchester University for two years from 1934. It was at this time he adopted the name George Grenfell Baines at the suggestion of fellow student Gerald Hayforthwaite. Later this was hyphenated as Grenfell- Baines: Grenfell being his mother's maiden name. He was known to friends and colleagues as"" GG"". In 1935, he was awarded the Heywood prize for the design of reinforced concrete flats. The following year he was awarded the third prize in a competition for a new Rhodesian Parliament; the prize money, £ 250, was enough to enable him to start his own practice. Grenfell- Baines's work for the Air Ministry during World War II brought him to the attention of Anthony Chitty and the London Modernists. Although Grenfell- Baines always chose to be based in Preston, he cultivated friendships in national and international circles. In 1951, he was invited to design a pavilion for the Festival of Britain. Grenfell- Baines's post-war work included the New Towns of Newton Aycliffe( planned 1947) and Peterlee( planned 1948).

The Pursuit of Happiness (1988 film)
The Pursuit of Happiness is a 1988 Australian film directed by Martha Ansara. In the mid 1980s Ansara was involved in the Australian anti-nuclear movement and wanted to make a film about Australia's relationship with the US. She originally intended to make a documentary but then it evolved into a dramatic feature about a married relationship that acted as a paradigm for the US- Australia relationship. Ansara: It was a bit of a crude analysis, but it took so long to make( under the 10 BA system) that by the time we finished the film- it was 1987- for various reasons, the anti-nuclear movement was on the way out, so the film missed its time. And with films, timing is everything. If we had done it in a year, which we could n't, it probably would have done very, very well. As it was, it did return 40 percent to the investors, but that was because it was very low- budget. The interesting thing about the film is that, if the audience was not very sophisticated, they liked it enormously. If they were sophisticated, they thought it was really daggy.

Andersson admitted that the film contains flaws, and he said that the main reason for them was that he was not completely in control of the production, and therefore he had to compromise in several scenes. He also suggested that the audience was not ready for the film, expecting it to be more similar to his previous film"" A Swedish Love Story I think they did n't understand what I was doing. Later, when Kubrick came out with"" Barry Lyndon"", people accepted that it's the same mood. But these things take time.""

Goli Soda

The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity"". Cinemalead.com rated it with 4/5 stars and said ""Overall if you prefer to watch a gutsy film which is different and unique from the routine Tamil cinema, go and watch Goli Soda which surely deserves a repeated viewing"".

Guido Fubini
Guido Fubini (19 January 1879 – 6 June 1943) was an Italian mathematician, known for Fubini's theorem and the Fubini–Study metric. Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied differential geometry under Ulisse Dini and Luigi Bianchi. His 1900 doctoral thesis was about Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces. After earning his doctorate, he took up a series of professorships. In 1901 he began teaching at the University of Catania in Sicily; shortly afterwards he moved to the University of Genoa; and in 1908 he moved to the Politecnico in Turin and then the University of Turin, where he would stay for a few decades. During this time his research focused primarily on topics in mathematical analysis, especially differential equations, functional analysis, and complex analysis; but he also studied the calculus of variations, group theory, non-Euclidean geometry, and projective geometry, among other topics. With the outbreak of World War I, he shifted his work towards more applied topics, studying the accuracy of artillery fire; after the war, he continued in an applied direction, applying results from this work to problems in electrical circuits and acoustics. In 1939, when Fubini at the age of 60 was nearing retirement, Benito Mussolini's Fascists adopted the anti-Jewish policies advocated for several years by Adolf Hitler's Nazis. As a Jew, Fubini feared for the safety of his family, and so accepted an invitation by Princeton University to teach there; he died in New York City four years later. A main belt asteroid, 22495 Fubini, was named in his honour.

"Alberic III, Count of Tusculum
Alberic III (died 1044) was the Count of Tusculum, along with Galeria, Preneste, and Arce, from 1024, when his brother the count Roman was elected Pope John XIX, until his own death. He was a son of Gregory I and Maria, brother of Popes Benedict VIII and John XIX, and brother-in-law of Thrasimund III of Spoleto.

Theodora (senatrix)
She was the mother of Marozia, alleged concubine to Pope Sergius III, and the mother of Pope John XI, fathered by—according to Liutprand of Cremona and the ""Liber Pontificalis""— Sergius. A third contemporary source, however—the annalist Flodoard (c. 894–966)—says John XI was the brother of Count Alberic II of Spoleto, the latter being the offspring of Marozia and her husband Count Alberic I of Spoleto. Hence John too was probably the son of Marozia and Alberic I.

Willa of Spoleto
Willa of Spoleto( also Willa of Tuscany)( – 7 January 978) was the daughter of Boniface I, duke of Spoleto. Through marriage to Hubert, Duke of Spoleto Willa became duchess of Spoleto and margravine of Tuscany.

Guy III of Spoleto (died 12 December 894) was the margrave of Camerino from 880 and then duke of Spoleto and Camerino from 883. He was crowned king of Italy in 889 and emperor in 891. He died in 894 while fighting for control of the Italian Peninsula. Guy was married to Ageltrude, daughter of Adelchis of Benevento, who bore him a son named Lambert.

Alberic II of Spoleto
Alberic II (912–954) was ruler of Rome from 932 to 954, after deposing his mother Marozia and his stepfather, King Hugh of Italy. He was of the house of the Counts of Tusculum, the son of Marozia by her first husband, Alberic I, Duke of Spoleto. His half-brother was Pope John XI. At the wedding of his mother to King Hugh of Italy, Alberic and his new stepfather quarreled violently after Hugh slapped Alberic for clumsiness. Infuriated by this and perhaps motivated by rumors that Hugh intended to have him blinded, Alberic left the festivities and incited a Roman mob to revolt against Hugh. In December 932 Hugh fled the city, Marozia was cast into prison, and Alberic took control of Rome.

Thrasimund I of Spoleto
Thrasimund I or Transamund I was the Count of Capua and then Duke of Spoleto( 663 – 703 AD), a faithful follower of Grimoald I of Benevento. Thrasimund assisted Grimoald in usurping the kingship of the Lombards. In return, Grimoald gave him his daughter in marriage and granted him the duchy of Spoleto after the death of Atto. Thrasimund co-ruled with his brother Wachilapus and was succeeded by his son Faroald II after a reign of forty years.

Lambert( c. 880 – 15 October 898) was the King of Italy from 891, Holy Roman Emperor, co-ruling with his father from 892, and Duke of Spoleto and Camerino( as Lambert II) from his father's death in 894. He was the son of Guy III of Spoleto and Ageltrude, born in San Rufino. He was the last ruler to issue a capitulary in the Carolingian tradition.

Sarlio of Spoleto
Sarlio was the Duke of Spoleto from 940 until 943. He was originally from Provence and served as a count of the palace under King Hugh. According to Liutprand of Cremona, the king gave money to Sarlio to raise opposition to Duke Anscar of Spoleto. Sarlio married the widow of the previous duke, Theobald I, a nephew("" nepos"") of Hugh's, and obtained information and followers in Spoleto. At a date unspecified, Sarlio raised a revolt against Anscar, who left the city of Spoleto to engage him in the battle of Spoleto. Although Sarlio did not enter the battle personally, his troops were victorious and Anscar was killed. In 941 Hugh took several monasteries in the march of Tuscany and the march of Fermo, including the abbey of Farfa, and gave them to Sarlio, who took the title"" rector of the Sabina"" according to the"" Chronicon Farfense"". In 943, Hugh forced Sarlio to retire to a monastery —accusing him of murdering Anscar—and placed his bastard son Hubert, already ruling Tuscany, in charge of Spoleto.

This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave – particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics. De Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave- like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927. The 1925 pilot- wave model, and the wave- like behaviour of particles discovered by de Broglie was used by Erwin Schrödinger in his formulation of wave mechanics. The pilot- wave model and interpretation was then abandoned, in favor of the quantum formalism, until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by David Bohm. Louis de Broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the Académie française in 1944, and served as Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. De Broglie became the first high- level scientist to call for establishment of a multi-national laboratory, a proposal that led to the establishment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research( CERN).

The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity"".

"Shepseskare
Shepseskare or Shepseskara (Egyptian for ""Noble is the Soul of Ra"") was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty (2494–2345 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.

Shepseskaf
Shepseskaf was the sixth and last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. He reigned 6 to 8 years starting circa 2510 BC. The only activities firmly datable to his reign are the completion of the temple complex of the Pyramid of Menkaure and the construction of its own mastaba tomb at South Saqqara, the Mastabat al-Fir’aun, ""stone bench of the pharaoh"".

Sheleph
Sheleph was a son of Joktan, of the family of Shem. (Gen. 10:26). Sheleph means ""drawing out"" or ""who draws out"" (Hitchcock's Bible Dictionary).

Khentkaus I
Khentkaus I, also referred to as Khentkawes, was a royal woman who lived in ancient Egypt during the Fourth and the Fifth Dynasties. She may have been a daughter of king Menkaure, the wife of both king Shepseskaf and king Userkaf (the founder of the Fifth Dynasty), the mother of king Sahure, and perhaps, in her own right, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt. Her mastaba at Giza – tomb LG100 – is located very close to Menkaure's pyramid complex. This close connection may point to a family relationship. Although the relationship is not clear, the proximity of the pyramid complex of Khentkaus to that of king Menkaure has led to the conjecture that she may have been his daughter.

The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book-length interview ""Hitchcock/Truffaut"" (1967), in response to filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, ""Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional."" However, it's been claimed this statement cannot be taken at face value. The 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with G. K. Chesterton's 1922 book of detective stories of the same name. Hitchcock decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the stories in the book.

Bertrand II of Provence
Bertrand II otherwise William VI( died 1093) was count of Provence following the death of his father Geoffrey I of Provence, though he is not mentioned until the next year( 1063). He was either the eldest or second eldest son of Geoffrey. There is much confusion concerning the last counts of Provence of the first and native dynasty. Both Geoffrey I and his brother Fulk Bertrand had sons named either William or Bertrand. It seems that Bertrand's cousin, Bertrand I, ruled as"" marchio""( margrave) until his death around 1094 and was succeeded in his titles by Raymond IV of Toulouse. By his wife Matilda, he had one daughter Cecilia, who married Bernard Ato IV, Viscount of Carcassonne.

Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse

He was the Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne and Margrave of Provence from 1094, and he spent the last five years of his life establishing the County of Tripoli in the Near East.

Helie of Burgundy
Helie of Burgundy (– 28 February 1141) was the daughter of Eudes I and Sibylla of Burgundy. In June 1095, she married Bertrand of Toulouse, as his second wife. The two had one son, Pons of Tripoli (–1137). Bertrand succeeded his father as Count of Toulouse in 1105, and in 1108, he set out for Outremer to claim his father's rights as Count of Tripoli. Helie accompanied him on this expedition, which resulted in the capture of Tripoli in 1109; shortly after, their nephew, William-Jordan died of wounds, giving Bertrand an undisputed claim to Tripoli. Bertrand died in 1112, and Pons succeeded him in Tripoli. Helie returned to France, where she married William III of Ponthieu in 1115. They had twelve children, including two named Robert, two named William, and two named Enguerrand: Helie died on 28 February 1141, in Perseigne Abbey in Neufchâtel-en-Saosnois.

His mother was Almodis de la Marche, but she was kidnapped by and subsequently married to Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona when William was a boy. He was married to Emma of Mortain (daughter of Robert, Count of Mortain and a niece of William of Normandy), who gave him one daughter, Philippa. He married twice, and produced two legitimate sons; neither, however, survived infancy, leaving daughter Philippa as his heiress. As Toulouse had no tradition of female inheritance, this raised a question with regard to succession. In 1088, when William departed for the Holy Land, he left his brother, Raymond of Saint-Gilles, to govern in his stead (and, it was later claimed, to succeed him). Within five years, William was dead, and Raymond in a perfect position to take power – although, after Philippa married William IX of Aquitaine, they laid claim to Toulouse and fought, off and on, for years to try to reclaim it from Raymond and his children. He was the great-grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine, by his daughter's marriage to William IX of Aquitaine, and Eleanor's descendants would continue to lay nominal claim to Toulouse based on descent from William IV.

Who Killed Marilyn?
""Who Killed Marilyn?"" is a song by Glenn Danzig, about questions surrounding the death of actress Marilyn Monroe, with the titular question suggesting she was murdered. Though Danzig's first solo single, the song has since been included on various collections by Danzig's group The Misfits. The B-side, ""Spook City USA"" was also recorded previously with the Misfits during the ""Night of the Living Dead"" EP session, but that much faster version was not released until the 1996 release of The Misfits Box Set. Danzig claims that he and Misfits drummer Googy couldn't get Jerry and guitarist Doyle to practice and perform more often, and ""Who Killed Marilyn?"" fulfilled Danzig's need to perform and release his songs on a more regular basis. Jerry claims he had no reason not to do the songs and doesn't know why Danzig released a solo single. Whatever the history behind the songs, ""Who Killed Marilyn?"" continued Danzig's obsession with the darker underside of American pop culture, as seen from the very first single's ""She"" (about Patty Hearst) to such songs as ""Violent World"" and ""American Nightmare"". Other versions of this song have been released by the Misfits (""Legacy of Brutality"", the Boxset, etc.), but the Glenn Danzig version recorded on this 45, along with the B-side, ""Spook City USA"", are only available on this 45 and have never been released on CD.

Yakov Iosifovich Dzhugashvili (– 14 April 1943) was the eldest of Joseph Stalin's three children, the son of Stalin's first wife, Kato Svanidze, who died 9 months after his birth. His father, then a young revolutionary in his mid-20s, left the child to be raised by his late wife's family. In 1921, when Dzhugashvili had reached the age of fourteen, he was brought to Moscow, where his father had become a leading figure in the Bolshevik government who eventually became head of the Soviet Union. Disregarded by Stalin, Dzhugashvili was a shy, quiet child who appeared quite unhappy and tried to commit suicide several times as a youth. Married twice, Dzhugashvili had three children, two who reached adulthood.

Which Way You Goin' Billy
There are two articles for Canadian band The Poppy Family:

Hard rock
From outside the United Kingdom and the United States, the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 (Rush, Fly by Night and Caress of Steel) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112. The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had formed in the late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit ""The Boys Are Back in Town"", which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US. Their style, consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony, proved itself to be a large influence on later bands. They reached their commercial, and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose: A Rock Legend (1979). The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre. Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock (1977) and Highway to Hell (1979). Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon and Venom.

"Sobe (sister of Saint Anne)
Sobe, also known as Sovin, was the mother of St. Elizabeth and sister of St. Anne. The Bible records only that Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron and a cousin( or relative) of Mary. The name of Sobe first appears in writings of about the 8th century by Hippolytus of Thebes, Andrew of Crete, and Epiphanius Monachus, and later in Nicephorus Callistus and Andronicus. All recount essentially the same passage, given by the last two as follows: There were three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest, and Mary his wife, under the reign of Cleopatra and Sosipatrus, before the reign of Herod, the son of Antipater: the eldest was Mary, the second was Sobe, the youngest's name was Anne. The eldest being married in Bethlehem, had for daughter Salome the midwife; Sobe the second likewise married in Bethlehem, and was the mother of Elizabeth; last of all the third married in Galilee, and brought forth Mary the mother of Christ. The 19th- century mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich claims that according to her visions( which give a detailed genealogy of Mary), Sobe was a sister of Anne, but the mother of Elizabeth was Emerentia, Sobe and Anne's maternal aunt.

Saint Anne
According to apocryphal Christian and Islamic tradition, Saint Anne was the mother of Mary and the maternal grandmother of Jesus. Mary's mother is not named in the canonical gospels. In writing, Anne's name and that of her husband Joachim come only from New Testament apocrypha, of which the Gospel of James (written perhaps around 150) seems to be the earliest that mentions them. The mother of Mary is mentioned, but not named, in the Quran.

Anne de Guigné

Sobekhotep might have had several wives, only one of which is known for certain, the ""king's wife"" Tjan. Several children are known. These are Amenhotep and Nebetiunet, both with Tjan as mother. There are three further king's sons: Sobekhotep Miu, Sobekhotep Djadja and Haankhef Iykhernofret. Their mother is not recorded in extant sources.

SOB
Sob is a verb meaning cry. Sob and SoB may refer to:

Mary, mother of Jesus
According to the writer of Luke, Mary was a relative of Elizabeth, wife of the priest Zechariah of the priestly division of Abijah, who was herself part of the lineage of Aaron and so of the tribe of Levi.[Luke 1:5;1:36] Some of those who consider that the relationship with Elizabeth was on the maternal side, consider that Mary, like Joseph, to whom she was betrothed, was of the House of David and so of the Tribe of Judah, and that the genealogy of Jesus presented in Luke 3 from Nathan, third son of David and Bathsheba, is in fact the genealogy of Mary,[need quotation to verify] while the genealogy from Solomon given in Matthew 1 is that of Joseph. (Aaron's wife Elisheba was of the tribe of Judah, so all their descendants are from both Levi and Judah.)[Num.1:7 & Ex.6:23]

Sainte-Anne

Is the Pope Catholic? may refer to:

Mary, mother of Jesus
According to the apocryphal Gospel of James, Mary was the daughter of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne. Before Mary's conception, Anne had been barren and was far advanced in years. Mary was given to service as a consecrated virgin in the Temple in Jerusalem when she was three years old, much like Hannah took Samuel to the Tabernacle as recorded in the Old Testament. Some apocryphal accounts state that at the time of her betrothal to Joseph, Mary was 12–14 years old, and he was thirty years old, but such accounts are unreliable.

Spanish was brought to Mexico in the 16th century. As in all other Spanish - speaking countries (including Spain), different accents and varieties of the language exist in different parts of the country, for both historical and sociological reasons. Among these, the varieties that are best known outside of the country are those of central Mexico -- both educated and uneducated varieties -- largely because the capital, Mexico City, hosts most of the mass communication media with international projection. For this reason, most of the film dubbing identified abroad with the label ``Mexican Spanish ''or`` Latin American Spanish'' actually corresponds to the central Mexican variety.

He is the twin brother of Princess Margaretha. He frequently goes by the name of Jean Nassau. On 26 September 1986, Prince Jean renounced his right of succession to the Luxembourg throne.

Marie of Luxembourg, Queen of France
Marie of Luxembourg (1304 – 26 March 1324), was by birth member of the House of Luxembourg and by marriage Queen of France and Navarre. She was the daughter of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and Margaret of Brabant. Her two siblings were John of Luxembourg and Beatrice of Luxembourg, Queen of Hungary.

E. B. Lewis
E. B. Lewis is the name of:

Prince Louis of Luxembourg
Prince Louis of Luxembourg( Louis Xavier Marie Guillaume; born 3 August 1986) is the third son of the Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg. Prince Louis has two elder siblings: Guillaume and Felix; and two younger siblings: Alexandra and Sébastien. He was married to Tessy Antony, a former NCO in the Luxembourg Army, from whom he separated in 2017. They have two sons: Prince Gabriel and Prince Noah.

Monarchy of Luxembourg
The Grand Duke of Luxembourg is the monarchical head of state of Luxembourg. Luxembourg has been a grand duchy since 15 March 1815, when it was elevated from a duchy, and was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands until 1890 under the House of Orange - Nassau and is the world's only sovereign grand duchy.

He was a younger son of John of Luxembourg, Lord of Beauvoir and Marguerite of Enghien. Lewis was elected archbishop of Rouen in 1436. He was the leading native administrator/collaborator with the Lancastrian regime in France. His niece Jacquetta was the wife of John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, who acted as regent for his nephew Henry VI. As the Lancastrian position weakened, Lewis found his own fortunes and even personal safety becoming precarious. Although the city of Rouen did not fall to Charles VII of France until late 1449, well after Luxembourg's death, King Henry's government had long ago decided the archbishop needed and deserved remuneration and status based more securely in England. Thus he was provided to Ely 'in commendam' on 27 September 1437. This was the fifth wealthiest see in England, yet also amongst the smallest in terms of size or burden. He is not known ever to have visited it. He died on 18 September 1443.

Mexican Spanish
Spanish was brought to Mexico in the 16th century. As in all other Spanish - speaking countries (including Spain), different accents and varieties of the language exist in different parts of the country, for both historical and sociological reasons. Among these, the varieties that are best known outside of the country are those of central Mexico -- both educated and uneducated varieties -- largely because the capital, Mexico City, hosts most of the mass communication media with international projection. For this reason, most of the film dubbing identified abroad with the label ``Mexican Spanish ''or`` Latin American Spanish'' actually corresponds to the central Mexican variety.

Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg was the daughter of Duke Wenceslas I of Saxe-Wittenberg, Duke of Lüneburg and Elector of Saxony and his wife Cecilia of Carrara. In 1386 she married with Duke Frederick I of Brunswick-Lüneburg. They had two daughters. In 1400 Frederick was elected King of the Germans. This election, however, was not recognized by three of the electors. Frederick was murdered on the way home, a month after the election. Anna's second marriage was with Landgrave Balthasar of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen. This marriage remained childless.

Rudolf III, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg
Rudolf III( – 11 June 1419), a member of the House of Ascania, was Duke of Saxe- Wittenberg and Elector of Saxony from 1388 until his death.

Anna of Saxony, Electress of Brandenburg
Anna of Saxony (7 March 1437 – 31 October 1512) was a princess of Saxony by birth and Electress of Brandenburg by marriage.

Anna of Saxony
Anna of Saxony (23 December 1544 – 18 December 1577) was the heiress of Maurice, Elector of Saxony, and Agnes, eldest daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. Maurice's only son, Albert, died in infancy. Anna was the second wife of William the Silent.

Rudolf II, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg
Rudolf II, Duke of Saxe- Wittenberg, nicknamed Rudolf the Blind,( – 6 December 1370 in Wittenberg) was a member of the House of Ascania, He was Elector of Saxony and Duke of Saxe- Wittenberg from 1356 until his death. He was the eldest son of Duke Rudolf I of Saxe- Wittenberg and his wife, Judith of Brandenburg- Salzwedel.

Anna of Saxony
Anna of Saxony (23 December 1544 – 18 December 1577) was the heiress of Maurice, Elector of Saxony, and Agnes, eldest daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. Maurice's only son, Albert, died in infancy. Anna was the second wife of William the Silent. Anna was born and died in Dresden. Her wealth drew many suitors; before the proposal of Orange in 1560, there were negotiations with the Swedish royal house. She accepted the suit of William I of Orange, and they were married on 25 August 1561.

Albert of Saxe-Wittenberg, Duke of Lüneburg
Albert of Saxe-Wittenberg (died 28 June 1385 in Wittenberg) was born as the son of Otto (d. 30 March 1350), a younger son of the prince-elector Rudolf I of Saxe-Wittenberg, and his (Otto's) wife Elisabeth, daughter of Duke William II of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1370 he succeeded his (maternal) grandfather as the Duke or Prince of Lüneburg. William II of Brunswick-Lüneburg named his grandson Albert as his heir in Lüneburg because neither he or his brother had male heirs. In fact William II had previously asked Emperor Charles IV for the eventual enfeoffment of the state to his grandson, but backed away again in the years that followed, because he feared the influence of Albert's uncles, Wenceslas I and Rudolf II. A further reason may be found in the terms of the Brunswick-Lüneburg investiture agreement of 1235 as well as the succession treaties agreed by William's father Otto the Strict with Brunswick-Lüneburg's Wolfenbüttel line of the House of Welf, according to which the principality had to be passed to any male heir within the entire Welf house if there were one. After the death of William II and the succession of the Wolfenbüttel Magnus II, the Lüneburg War of Succession broke out between Saxe-Wittenberg and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Albert was backed by his uncle the Prince-Elector Wenceslas of Saxony (Saxe-Wittenberg). On 25 July 1373, Duke Magnus was killed in a battle near Leveste on the Deister (part of modern-day Gehrden). After this an arrangement was agreed between Prince-Elector Wenceslas and Albert, on the one hand and the widow of Magnus II and her sons on the other. It was agreed that the land would belong, undivided, to the two Ascanians from Saxe-Wittenberg and, after their deaths, would be transferred to the sons of the fallen duke, Magnus II. And that it should continue to alternate after the deaths of the Welfs, i.e. the succession would pass to the Ascanians again. In order that this plan could also be reinforced by family ties, in 1374 Albert of Saxe-Lüneburg married the widow of Magnus II, Catharina and chose Celle as his home, which he made a residence in 1378. The two still underage sons of Magnus also married into the House of Ascania in 1386. He would rule the Principality of Lüneburg jointly with his uncle Wenceslas until his death on 28 June 1385.

Anna Sophie of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg

He was appointed as provost in Hamburg in 1676, after chairman Kielmansegge died. When his father died in 1689, the will stated that his possessions would go to his widow, who would have the right to settle the succession. She made a decision, which was upheld by the King in 1692. Her eldest living son, Ernest Augustus, was excluded from the inheritance, because he had converted to Catholicism, leaving the Duchy to Frederick William, who was by then the only other surviving son. Almost simultaneously, Frederick William was also appointed governor of Sønderborg. However, when Ernest Augustus reverted to Lutheranism in 1695, he was appointed governor of Sønderborg, because he resided there. Ernest Augustus was also reinstated as heir of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. Nevertheless, when Ernest Augustus died childless in 1731, Frederick William's son Christian August I would inherit the duchy. When his mother died in 1701, Frederick William inherited Augustenborg Palace, Rumohrsgaard Manor and Evelgunde Manor. In 1703, he purchased Avnbølgaard Manor in Sundeved. Frederick William served as a Major General in the Danish army. On 27 November 1694, he married Sophie Amalie, a daughter of the Chancellor, Frederick of Ahlefeldt, Count of Langeland. She died on 24 December 1741.

With the death of King Frederick William IV on 2 January 1861, his brother, who had acted as regent since 1858, ascended the throne as King William I.

You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch
Jim Carrey sang this song in the 2000 live action film adaptation, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, as the Grinch himself.

Is There Anybody Out There?
The second half of the song is an instrumental classical guitar solo. Interestingly, it is not widely known who played it: In several interviews, David Gilmour has said that he tried to perform it, and was not satisfied with the final result (``I could play it with a leather pick but could n't play it properly fingerstyle ''). Accordingly, session musician Joe DiBlasi was brought in by Michael Kamen to play with the rest of the orchestra. He was ultimately wrongly credited as`` Ron DiBlasi'' on the album sleeve because Roger Waters only remembered that it was a three - letter name; Ron was the closest name he could remember to Joe when creating the record.

There's a Skeeter on My Peter
The earliest printed example of this song is found in the book Parodology (1927) where the melody is listed as an adaptation of the tune ``Little Bit of Love ''. This song has been commercially recorded by Valby and by an anonymous person on the 1960 LP The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men.

""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"" is a song written by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin for the 1937 film ""Shall We Dance"", where it was introduced by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers as part of a celebrated dance duet on roller skates. The music is marked ""Brightly"". The song is most famous for its ""You like tomato / And I like to-mah-to "" and other verses comparing their different regional dialects. The differences in pronunciation are not simply regional, however, but serve more specifically to identify class differences. At the time, typical American pronunciations were considered less ""refined"" by the upper-class, and there was a specific emphasis on the ""broadera"" sound. This class distinction with respect to pronunciation has been retained in caricatures, especially in the theater, where the longer ""a"" pronunciation is most strongly associated with the word ""darling."" The song was ranked No. 34 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs.

Sink or Swim (1990 film)
Sink or Swim is an experimental film written and directed by Su Friedrich originally released in 1990. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it"" culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Through a series of twenty six short stories,"" Sink or Swim"" describes the childhood events that shaped a girl's ideas about fatherhood, family relations, work and play. As the stories unfold, a dual portrait emerges: that of a father who cared more for his career than for his family, and of a daughter who was deeply affected by his behavior. Working in counterpoint to the forceful text are sensual black and white images that depict both the extraordinary and ordinary events of daily life. Together, they create a formally complex and emotionally intense film. The film's title comes from an incident from Friedrich's childhood when her father taught her to swim by throwing her in the water after explaining the science behind swimming.
