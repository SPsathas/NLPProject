Nicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother, who completed the group and a four-track EP was then recorded. Soon later, Renegades became an alternative name for Feeder at various concerts where they would play an entire show pretending not to be Feeder, but a different band with the same members. If Feeder songs released before the \"Renegades\" album were to be played, the band would announce that they're covering Feeder songs. Grant Nicholas once introduced \"Tangerine\" as \"A cover of a song from a band we know\". The idea was created when Feeder parted company with drummer Mark Richardson who returned to his previous band Skunk Anansie. Brazil was initially contracted with the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university events, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was however recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before the idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the 'Renegades' project. The tracks originally intended for the side-project were soon used for the seventh Feeder album \"Renegades\". The side-project was as a result used as a method to promote the \"Renegades\" album at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder. On the first of January 2010, a four-day countdown timer was added to the band's official website. As the countdown was completed on 6 January 2010, the title-track for the EP, \"Renegades\" was released as a free download as well as a package containing the limited edition EP, Renegades shirt, badge set and an e-ticket for one of the six shows available. The \"Renegades EP\" was the first release on the band's own record label, before being followed-up by a second EP. Feeder also used the Renegades name for their Sonisphere 2010 appearance, which was their last UK show using this name and also their tour of Japan in July of the same year. The track \"Renegades\" was re-released, but this time as a Feeder single instead of Renegades and was also on vinyl and download only.\n\nY\u016bki Meguro\nY\u016bki Meguro is a Japanese actor.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of ``childlike sensibilities ''they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things`` was the best thing ever''. To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered ``bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War ''such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia. Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series, crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror. The Duffer Brothers have cited as influence for the show (among others): Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Robert Zemeckis, George Lucas and Guillermo del Toro; films such as Alien and Stand by Me; Japanese anime such as Akira and Elfen Lied; and video games such as Silent Hill, The Last of Us, and Dark Souls.

It was recorded at the first \"John Wesley Harding\" session on October 17, 1967. It has been covered by many artists, including Joan Baez on her all-Dylan album \"Any Day Now\", as well as by Vic Chesnutt, Eric Clapton, John Doe, Thea Gilmore, Adam Selzer and Dirty Projectors. In addition, Jimi Hendrix at one point intended to cover this song, but felt it was too personal to Dylan and instead covered a different song from the album, \"All Along the Watchtower\". \"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" is a pensive ballad. Like the rest of the \"John Wesley Harding\" album, the music of \"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" uses spare, unobtrusive musical accompaniment. The primary instruments are an acoustic guitar and drums. The lyrics describe a dream that is enigmatic and subject to interpretation. However, the lyrics do convey a deeply felt sense of guilt, as well as a vision of faith, righteousness, fear and betrayal. The sense of guilt is particularly prevalent in the final verse: The opening couplet of the song paraphrases the song \"Joe Hill\", which begins with the lines \"I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night\", by Alfred Hayes and Earl Robinson. \" Joe Hill\" was a folk song written as a tribute to the union organizer Joe Hill, who was viewed by supporters as a martyr after he was convicted of a motiveless murder based on weak evidence. The reference is ironic, since the song seems to deny the existence of modern martyrs to lead humanity towards salvation. The St. Augustine in the title has often been linked to St. Augustine of Hippo, although St. Augustine of Hippo was not martyred, but died during the Vandal sack of Hippo. He was, however, a philosopher who wrote about evil and guilt, he defined the concept of original sin and therefore mankind's ultimate guilt, and could have viewed himself as being martyred in the sense of being killed by his own sins. In the dream revealed in the song, St. Augustine wears a coat of solid gold, which may signify either the worldly excesses of mankind and the Catholic Church or St. Augustine's own spiritual wealth. He also carries a blanket, which may be a sign of asceticism or of his compassion. St. Augustine searches for \"the very souls / Whom already have been sold,\" a reference to the commercialization of mankind's inner self, a motif that will recur on later songs on the album such as \"Dear Landlord\" and \"The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\". He tells \"ye gifted kings and queens\" that \"No martyr is among ye now,\" but consoles them with the knowledge that nonetheless they are not alone. But the dream ends with the narrator realizing that he himself is among those that put St. Augustine to death, initiating his feelings of guilt as he now sees the error of his ways. One interpretation of the song is that St. Augustine is a stand-in for Dylan himself, who had been viewed as a prophet or messiah, was nearly \"martyred\" in a motorcycle accident a few months before the song was written, but in any case had come too late since mankind (including himself) had already sold its soul to many temptations. Another possible interpretation is that Dylan sees himself as being among those who \"put Him out to death,\" a reference to responsibility for the death of Jesus, the ultimate expression of personal guilt. In a 2005 poll of artists published by \"MojoI Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" was listed as the #76 greatest Bob Dylan song of all time. Dylan played the song live, in a slow waltz arrangement, at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969, a performance included on \"Isle of Wight Live\", part of the 4-CD deluxe edition of . He also played the song live on the Rolling Thunder Revue in the 1970s, as may be heard on the box set , and with the Heartbreakers in the 1980s, but has rarely performed the song live since.

The duke and duchess were divorced in 1700, due to her adulterous relationship with Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet, whom she married a year later; a previous effort by the Duke to divorce her in 1692 had failed. Although he had obtained damages in an action for criminal conversation, in which the details of her affair were revealed in lurid detail, the jury awarded her husband only \u00a366 instead of the \u00a3100,000 he had asked for. This no doubt reflects their opinion of the Duke's own conduct: his own counsel remarked that his charges against Germain were an example of \"the pot calling the kettle black\".

If one of the tanks is empty, the bivalent BMW engine unit switches over automatically to the other fuel system. One decisive advantage of the combustion engine is bivalence. It enables both hydrogen and petrol to be used, thus creating the ideal conditions for a transition from non-regenerative to regenerative drive energies. During electrolysis water is split into its components of hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is stored and the oxygen is needed in the vehicle for the combustion of the hydrogen. The combustion process generates energy and water as a waste product, which returns to the natural water cycle. And so with the aid of regenerative energy suppliers, a theoretically emission-free fuel is obtained.\n\nSheba, Baby\nSheba, Baby is a 1975 American blaxploitation action film directed by William Girdler and starring Pam Grier and Austin Stoker.\n\nFrancisco de Paula (actor)\nFrancisco de Paula( 1914\u20131985) was an Argentine film actor.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.\n\nWillem Lodewijk de Vos van Steenwijk\nWillem Lodewijk, Baron de Vos van Steenwijk (10 July 1859 \u2013 12 April 1947) was a conservative Dutch politician.

Their father was John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who led the English government from 1550\u20131553 under Edward VI and unsuccessfully tried to establish Lady Jane Grey on the English throne after the King's death in July 1553. For his participation in this venture Ambrose Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London and condemned to death. Reprieved, his rehabilitation came after he fought for Philip II of Spain (then England's co-monarch) in the Battle of St. Quentin. On Queen Elizabeth's accession in November 1558 Dudley was appointed Master of the Ordnance, in which capacity he was to unofficially assist William the Silent in his struggle against Spain by delivering English weaponry. As the senior member of his family, Dudley was created Earl of Warwick in December 1561. In 1562\u20131563 he commanded the army Elizabeth sent to Le Havre to garrison the town and assist the Huguenots in the First French War of Religion. This campaign ended in failure when the French belligerents agreed on a peace and the English surrendered because of the plague which was decimating their ranks. Dudley, who had acted honorably throughout, returned with a severe leg wound which was to hinder his further career and ultimately led to his death 27 years later. His last military engagement was against the Northern rebels in 1569. From 1573 he served as a privy councillor. Despite three marriages, Ambrose Dudley remained childless after the death of an infant daughter in 1552. This had serious repercussions for the survival of his dynasty, since his only surviving brother Robert equally died without legitimate issue. With him, Ambrose Dudley had a very close relationship, and in business and personal life they did many things together. Like Robert Dudley, Ambrose was a major patron of the Elizabethan Puritan movement and supported non-conforming preachers in their struggle with the Church authorities. Due to his homely way of life\u2014and in contrast to the colourful Earl of Leicester\u2014Ambrose Dudley became known to posterity as the \"Good Earl of Warwick\".\n\nWhich country Audofleda's husband is from?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

About 70% of women and men do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy.Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) which is most often spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also spread through genital touching. People who are infected may spread the disease even when symptoms are not present. Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in the vaginal fluid using a microscope, culturing the vagina or urine, or testing for the parasite's DNA. If present other STIs should be tested for.Methods of prevention include not having sex, using condoms, not douching, and being tested for STIs before having sex with a new partner. Trichomoniasis can be cured with antibiotics, either metronidazole or tinidazole. Sexual partners should also be treated. About 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatment.There were about 122 million new cases of trichomoniasis in 2015. In the United States, there are about 2 million women affected. It occurs more often in women than men. Trichomonas vaginalis was first identified in 1836 by Alfred Donn\u00e9.

The song reveals the backstory of Jessie, a toy cowgirl, as she reflects upon her defunct relationship with her original owner, by whom she was outgrown. Heard in the film during a flashback sequence, the filmmakers decided to incorporate a song into the montage during which Jessie details her backstory to Woody after multiple attempts to show the character relaying her experience verbally proved unsuccessful. Newman initially felt that the song was not suitable because he doubted young children would be interested in it. The song was offered to McLachlan after Newman and the filmmakers agreed that the ballad was more appropriate for a female artist. Despite some hesitation from her management, McLachlan greatly enjoyed the ballad and agreed to record it upon hearing Newman's demo, finding herself drawn towards its melancholy nature. Musically,\" When She Loved Me\" is an emotional pop ballad backed by simple piano accompaniment. Various interpretations of the song's lyrics and themes have been offered; while\" When She Loved Me\" is primarily about the pain felt upon losing a platonic friend, it has also been interpreted as a love song, while some music journalists consider the track to be a metaphor for children inevitably growing up and becoming independent from their parents. \" When She Loved Me\" has garnered positive reviews from film and music critics, who found the song to be both moving and heartbreaking, praising Newman's songwriting and McLachlan's vocal performance. \" When She Loved Me\" won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The song was nominated for Golden Globe and Academy Awards for Best Original Song but lost both to\" You'll Be in My Heart\" from Disney's\" Tarzan\"( 1999). \" When She Loved Me\" has since earned a reputation as one of the saddest sequences in both Pixar and Disney films, as well as one of the saddest film songs ever written. The song has been covered by several artists, including Steve Tyrell, Bridgit Mendler and the musical group Steps.\n\nWho is the paternal grandfather of Kuj\u014d Yoritsugu?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

She was born Agnes Dunbar Moodie on a farm near Coburg, Ontario. Her parents were John Wedderburn Dunbar Moodie and Susanna Moodie. Around five years later, the family moved to Belleville. She learned how to paint flowers from her mother. Her mother, famously, published \"Roughing it in the Bush\", a romantic history about the harshness of Canadian rural living during the 1830s. \"Roughing it\" was published in 1852, and has remained in demand and inspired writers such as Margaret Atwood to the present day. In 1868, \"Canadian Wild Flowers\" was published, viewed as one of the first serious botanical works published in Canada, which included text by Catharine Parr Traill. The book, very expensive for its time, was sold by subscription, largely through its author's own efforts; as an enterprising widow, she also worked as an illustrator to support her children and herself. Fitzgibbon was married twice: first around 1850 to Charles Thomas FitzGibbon, a barrister, who died in 1865 and then in 1870 to Brown Chamberlin, later the Queen's Printer. She had eight children with her first husband and one with her second. In 1863 she began her paintings of Canadian flora to illustrate a book by her aunt Catharine Parr Traill. After the death of her husband, she began work on a book of Canadian wild flowers, with her water-coloured illustrations and Traill's text. The book attracted 500 subscriptions, a significant number at the time. \"Canadian Wild Flowers\" first edition was published in 1868. The second and third subscribed editions were published in 1869 (Montreal: J. Lovell); and a fourth edition in 1895 (Toronto: W. Briggs). Her paintings of Canadian plants and flowers were also published in other books on Canadian flora, with 9 full page colour lithographs in Catherine Traill's \"Studies ofPlant Life in Canada\" (Ottawa: A.S. Woodburn, 1885). In 1972, 11 of the watercolour paintings were reproduced in Eustella Langdon's \"Pioneer Gardens\" (Toronto: Holt Rinehart and Winston). She died in Toronto in 1913. Agnes Chamberlin's heirs presented her paintings and copies of \"Canadian Wild Flowers\" and \"Studies of Plant Life in Canada\" to the University of Toronto in 1934\u20135. They became part of the University's Botany Department, Then, in 1966, the collection of books and paintings were transferred to the Rare Books and Special Collections of the University of Toronto Library in 1966.

They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan.'' In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa, Kengor said, ``Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it was n't replaced by a Marxist - totalitarian regime allied with Moscow and Cuba that would take the South African people down the same road as Ethiopia, Mozambique, and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went Communist. It was devastating.

On 11 September 1964, Harrison created Mornyork Ltd, which, by 7 December that year, had changed its name to Harrisongs Ltd. The company is headquartered at 27 Ovington Square in London's Knightsbridge district, in the same building that houses the Beatles' Apple Corps. Harrison's earliest Beatles compositions were published by Northern Songs, the company set up in 1963 by Dick James and Brian Epstein on behalf of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were the main songwriting Beatles. Harrison and Ringo Starr had both signed contracts with Northern Songs, but neither was satisfied with their subsequent writer's royalties and the lowly status implicit in this business arrangement. In 1967, Harrison wrote \"Only a Northern Song\" about his dissatisfaction with the company. He duly let his Northern Songs contract expire in March 1968 and adopted Harrisongs for his music publishing, while Starr founded Startling Music. Harrison's 1968 solo album \"Wonderwall Music\" was the last release on which his new compositions were published by Northern Songs and its US counterpart, Maclen Music. That year, Harrisongs published \"Sour Milk Sea\", together with his four contributions to the Beatles' eponymous double album, including \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". Harrison's two songs on the band's 1969 album \" Abbey RoadHere Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", became the most widely syndicated compositions from that album, due in part to the number of cover versions they attracted. With over 150 cover recordings and the enduring popularity of the Beatles' version, \"Something\" provided Harrisongs with what author Mark Lewisohn terms \"a rich flow of royalties down the years\". Lewisohn also comments that, with Harrison's ownership of the company increasing from 80 per cent to 100 per cent in 1970, the move from Northern Songs proved especially beneficial, as disagreements between Lennon and McCartney had resulted in them losing control and much of the revenue generated from their songs.<ref name=\"Lewisohn /Something\"></ref> Harrison's company also published his early post-Beatles solo work, including the songs from \"All Things Must Pass\". In 1973, Harrison assigned the publishing rights for his new album, \"Living in the Material World\", to the Material World Charitable Foundation, a Harrisongs-administered charitable organisation he set up to aid starving countries. His songs from 1974's \"Dark Horse\" onwards were originally published by Ganga Publishing, B.V. in the United States and Oops Publishing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. They are now published by Umlaut Corporation, which is controlled by the composer's widow, Olivia Harrison. As of 2016, the Harrisongs catalogue is administered worldwide by the Bicycle Music Company, a division of Concord Music.
