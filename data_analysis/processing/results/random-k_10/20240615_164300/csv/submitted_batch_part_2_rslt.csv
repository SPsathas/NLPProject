Antonia Malatesta of Cesena, also known as Antonia Malatesta of Rimini, was the daughter (or possibly the niece) of Carlo I Malatesta, Lord of Cesena, Fano, Pesaro, and Rimini. To help ally himself with the House of Malatesta, Giovanni Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan married Antonia in the city of Brescia in 1408. They had no issue. After Giovanni Maria’s assassination in 1412, the succeeding Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, permitted Antonia to continue sharing the governance of the duchy for a few months. Although she soon retired to Cesena, she retained her title, Duchess of Milan.

Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (consul 33)
Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix was a Roman senator of the first century AD. He was a ""consul ordinarius"" in AD 33 as the colleague of Galba, the future emperor. Felix was the son of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Faustus, and a great-grandnephew of the famed statesman Lucius Cornelius Sulla. His mother was Sextia and his older brother was Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus. Felix may be the Lucius Sulla Tacitus describes under the year 21 as coming into conflict with the future general Domitius Corbulo over who was of higher rank at a gladiatorial show. ""Corbulo had age, national usage, and the feelings of the older senators in his favor,"" writes Tacitus. "" Against him Mamercus Scaurus, Lucius Arruntius and other kinsmen of Sulla strenuously exerted themselves. "" The matter was brought to the Senate where arguments filled the room until Drusus intervened and brought the body back to order. The matter was resolved when both Sulla and Scaurus apologized to Corbulo. Ronald Syme argues for this identification, and as Scaurus is identified as Felix's uncle and step-father, concludes that Scaurus had married his mother Sextia after the death of his father, and the grandfather of Felix and the father of Scaurus had married the same woman. An inscription recorded at Pisidian Antioch describes Felix as brother-in-law to Germanicus; Ronald Syme interprets this as proof that he was briefly married to Agrippina the Younger between the death of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus in the year 41 and her marriage to Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus.

The Falkland Islands have a land area of 4,700 square miles (12,000 km2) and a coastline estimated at 800 miles (1,300 km).

Outside of these significant settlements is the area colloquially known as ""Camp"", which is derived from the Spanish term for countryside (Campo).The climate of the islands is cold, windy and humid maritime. Variability of daily weather is typical throughout the archipelago. Rainfall is common over half of the year, averaging 610 millimetres (24 in) in Stanley, and sporadic light snowfall occurs nearly all year.

He was a conservative leader, primarily committed to political and social stability. Trained in law, Poincaré was elected as a Deputy in 1887 and served in the cabinets of Dupuy and Ribot. In 1902, he co-founded the Democratic Republican Alliance, the most important centre-right party under the Third Republic, becoming Prime Minister in 1912 and serving as President of the Republic from 1913 to 1920. He single-handedly controlled French foreign policy from 1912 to the beginning of World War I, being noted for his strongly anti-German attitudes, visiting Russia in 1912 and 1914 to repair Franco-Russian relations, which had become strained over the Bosnian Crisis of 1908 and the Agadir Crisis of 1911, and giving France's support for Russian military mobilization during the July Crisis of 1914. From 1917, he exercised less influence as his political rival Georges Clemenceau had become Prime Minister. At the Paris Peace Conference, he favoured Allied occupation of the Rhineland. In 1922 Poincaré returned to power as Prime Minister. In 1923 he ordered the Occupation of the Ruhr to enforce payment of German reparations. By this time Poincaré was seen, especially in the English-speaking world, as an aggressive figure (""Poincaré-la-Guerre"") who had helped to cause the war in 1914 and who now favoured punitive anti-German policies.

""Starflight"" was developed by Binary Systems, a five-man team consisting of Rod McConnell, Greg Johnson (lead designer), Alec Kercso (programming), Tim C. Lee (graphics and programming), and Bob Gonsalves (sound). Then-vice president of Electronic Arts Joe Ybarra was also closely involved, and produced the work. The original idea for making a video game was conceived by McConnell and Ybarra in 1983. McConnell hired colleague Dave Boulton, who had an idea for using fractals to generate an endless virtual universe, along with Kercso, Gonsalves, Lee, and Johnson, all of whom were first time game designers. Boulton quit the project early on in development, saying it was too ambitious, with Lee replacing him.

Al-A'sha
Al- A'sha or Maymun Ibn Qays Al- A'sha( d.c. 570 – 625) was an Arabic Jahiliyyah poet from Riyadh, Najd. He traveled through Mesopotamia, Syria, Arabia and Ethiopia. He was nicknamed Al- A'sha which means"" weak- sighted"" or"" night- blind"" after he lost his sight. He continued to travel even after becoming blind, particularly along the western coast of the Arabian peninsula. It was then that he turned to the writing of panegyrics as a means of support. His style, reliant on sound effects and full- bodied foreign words, tends to be artificial. His love poems are devoted to the praise of Huraira, a black female slave. Even before the time of Mohammed he is said to have believed in the Resurrection and Last Judgment, and to have been a monotheist. These beliefs may have been due to his interactions with the bishop of Najrān and the' Ibādites( Christians) of Al- Hirah. His poems were praised for their descriptions of the wild ass, for the praise of wine, for their skill in praise and satire, and for the varieties of metre employed. One of his"" qasidah"" or odes is sometimes included in the Mu'allaqat, an early Arabic poetry collection done by the critic Abu' Ubaydah.

Die Stadt ohne Juden (""The City Without Jews"") is a 1924 Austrian Expressionist film by Hans Karl Breslauer, based on the book of the same title by Hugo Bettauer. The film is one of the few surviving Expressionist films from Austria and has therefore been well researched. The film was first shown on 25 July 1924 in Vienna. In his novel, published in 1922, Hugo Bettauer succeeded in creating a relatively accurate allegorical vision of the near future, although the book was intended as entertainment and as a satirical response to the primitive antisemitism of the 1920s. It immediately became Bettauer's most popular work: it was translated into several languages, and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Shortly after the premiere of the film Hugo Bettauer was murdered by Otto Rothstock, a former member of the Nazi Party, who was lionized by the antisemitic Austrian masses and was released less than two years after having been committed to a psychiatric institution.

Out of the Inkwell was a major animated series of the silent era produced by Max Fleischer from 1918 to 1929. The series was the result of three short experimental films that Max Fleischer independently produced in the period of 1914 – 1916 to demonstrate his invention, the Rotoscope, which was a device consisting of a film projector and easel used as an aid for achieving realistic movement for animated cartoons. The Rotoscope would project motion picture film through an opening in the easel, covered by a glass pane serving as a drawing surface. The image on the projected film was traced onto paper, advancing the film one frame at a time as each drawing would be made. Fleischer's younger brother Dave Fleischer, who was working as a clown at Coney Island, served as the model for their first famous character, eventually known as"" Koko the Clown."" "" Out of the Inkwell"" began at the Bray Studio as a monthly entry in"" The Bray Pictorgraph Screen Magazine"" produced for Paramount from 1918, and later for Goldwyn from 1920 to 1921. In that same year, The Fleischer brothers started their own studio, and in 1923, the clown who previously had no name came to be known as KO- KO when animation veteran Dick Huemer became the new Director of Animation. Huemer, who began his animation career with the"" Mutt and Jeff"" cartoons in 1916, brought the influence of the short and tall companions to"" Out of the Inkwell"" with the creation of a small canine companion named Fitz, who would later evolve into Bimbo in the sound era. Huemer redesigned the clown for animation, which reduced the Fleischer's dependency on the Rotoscope for fluid animation. He also defined the drawing style with his distinctive inking quality that the series was famous for. But it was the interaction of the live action sequences with the artist/ creator, Max Fleischer and his pen and ink creations that was the foundation of the series. Typically, the cartoons start out with live action showing Max drawing the characters on paper, or opening the inkwell to release the characters into"" reality."" The"" Out of the Inkwell"" series ran from 1918 to mid 1927, and was renamed"" The Inkwell Imps"" for Paramount, continuing until 1929. In all, 62"" Out of the Inkwell"" and 56"" Inkwell Imps"" films were produced within 11 years. "" The Inkwell Imps"" series was replaced by the"" Talkartoons"" in 1929, and Koko was retired until 1931, appearing as a supporting character with Bimbo and Betty Boop. Koko's last theatrical appearance was in the Betty Boop cartoon,"" Ha- Ha- Ha""( 1934), which was a remake of the silent"" Out of the Inkwell"" film,"" The Cure""( 1924). Koko had a brief cameo in his only color theatrical appearance in the"" Screen Song"" entry,"" Toys will be Toys""( 1949). In 1950, Stuart Productions released a number of the Inkwell Studios"" Out of the Inkwell"" cartoons, and a selection of the Paramount"" Inkwell Imps"" cartoons to television. In 1955, the"" Inkwell Imps"", along with 2,500 pre-October 1950 Paramount shorts and cartoons were sold to television packagers, the majority acquired by U.M.& M. TV Corporation. In 1958, Max Fleischer reactivated his studio in a partnership with Hal Seeger, and in 1960 produced a series of 100"" Out Of The Inkwell"" five- minute cartoons. In the new color series, KoKo had a clown girlfriend named KoKette, a pal named Kokonut and a villain named Mean Moe. Larry Storch provided the voice for KoKo and all of the supporting characters.

Gene
Additionally, genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.

Madame Royale
Madame Royale("" Royal Lady"") was a style customarily used for the eldest living unmarried daughter of a reigning French monarch. It was similar to the style"" Monsieur"", which was typically used by the King's second son. Just as Gaston, duc d'Orléans( 1608 – 1660), the second son of King Henry IV of France( 1553 – 1610), was known as"" Monsieur"", Elisabeth of Bourbon( 1602 – 1644), the eldest daughter of Henry, was known before her marriage to King Philip IV of Spain( 1605 – 1665) as"" Madame Royale"". After her death, the title was borne by her younger sister, Christine Marie of France( 1606 – 1663), until her marriage to Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy( 1587 – 1637). The most famous holder of this honorific was King Louis XVI of France's eldest daughter, Marie- Thérèse- Charlotte( 1778 – 1851), the only one of his immediate family to survive the French Revolution. She later married her cousin, Louis- Antoine, duc d'Angoulême( 1775 – 1844), and played a prominent role during the Bourbon Restoration. The style"" Madame Royale"" was not regulated by any other code than that of etiquette. Its very simplicity, however, was considered more desirable than being known more formally as"" Son Altesse RoyaleYour Royal Highness"") in conversation. The style was customarily held until the death of the royal parent or until the princess married. The equivalent style in Great Britain is"" Princess Royal"". This title came into existence when Queen Henrietta Maria( 1609 – 1669), another daughter of King Henry IV of France, and the wife of King Charles I of England( 1600 – 1649), wanted to imitate in the Kingdom of England the way in which the eldest daughter of the sovereign in France was styled"" Madame Royale."" In Savoy, Henrietta Maria's older sister, Christine Marie of France, became known as Madama Reale in reference to her French manner of address. Her daughter- in- law, Marie Jeanne of Savoy, when she became regent of Savoy after the early death of her husband, called herself Madama Reale, after her mother- in- law, who had also been a regent of Savoy. This was despite the fact that Marie Jeanne's father was not a king.

Georg Haupt
Haupt learnt his trade during a period when the French rococo had established itself in Swedish furniture design, but came to Paris in 1764, when the neoclassical style later known under the name of Louis XVI had started to gain ground. Details of his life in Paris are scarce but he was probably employed in the workshop of Simon Oeben, the brother of the better-known Jean-François Oeben. He had come to London at some point before early February 1768, and may have been independently active as a cabinetmaker—a possibility thanks to the more liberal trade regulations in England—and remained there until July 1769, when his appointment as cabinetmaker to the King prompted him to return to Stockholm. His first royal commission was to be a desk intended as a gift for the Queen. After some pressure from the King, the Stockholm carpentry guild allowed him to use the completed piece to qualify as a master, even though there were Stockholm journeymen older than him waiting for their turn. Having been allowed into the Guild in 1770, he became a burgess in Stockholm the following year, establishing a workshop in rented premises at Trumpetarbacken, Norrmalm, which during the following years would employ three and later four journeymen and a few apprentices and produce furniture for the royal court and the Swedish social and economic elite.

Bob Tomalski
Bob Tomalski ( 7 February 1953- 13 January 2001), was a journalist,"" gadget guru"", broadcaster and longtime proponent of radio broadcasting freedom. Tomalski was a technology journalist: he founded"" Home Cinema Choice"" magazine and contributed to many other magazines on the subjects of TV, video, satellite TV, mobile phones and camcorders. He also appeared regularly on Sky News' weekly"" Technofile"" programme, reviewing gadgets alongside presenter Martin Stanford. He was also a regular contributor to"" Media Network"", a communications magazine on the English service of Radio Netherlands. Tomalski started his broadcasting career on the south west London pirate scene of the 1970s, where he became best known as the host of Roger Tate's Mailbox Show on European Music Radio, later becoming a licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign G6CQF. His maisonette in Mitcham, Surrey was equipped with a broadcast- quality mixing desk and two Nakamichi cassette decks, alongside the high- quality turntables. These were complemented by a collection of several thousand albums, mainly of his favourite genre; soul and funk, but topped up with many chart albums and a few hundred 60s and 70s rock records. He was also a collector of state of the art video equipment. He was a co-founder of Wandle Valley Radio( WVR) in 1984, still under the pseudonym"" Roger Tate"", broadcasting a soul/ funk/ hi-energy programme- he was a friend of the hi-energy artist Hazell Dean- alongside Alan Rogers and Paul James( both pseudonyms for obvious reasons). He provided the studio facilities for the station, which was amongst the pioneers of microwave links from the studio to the FM Band II transmitter, a technology later very widely used in pirate radio. Another technology which Tomalski pioneered was that of computer data transmission via Band II FM radio- raw data transmitted onto the audio signal with no subcarrier: WVR featured the"" Roger Tate Computer Program Programme"" with Tomalski introducing( after the music had ended for the night) half an hour of 8- bit data sounds played from a Nakamichi cassette deck, representing programs for the BBC Micro and the Tandy TRS- 80 microcomputers, among others. Surprisingly, for such an innovation being broadcast into listeners homes late at night, the telephone and postal feedback on the programme was overwhelmingly positive; a tribute to Tomalski's broadcasting skills. His home studio was raided in the late 80s after alleged transmission offences, and the Home Office even went as far as confiscating his electric kettle( as well as the studio gear), on the grounds that it was connected to the same ring main as his transmitting equipment. In his subsequent radio career, Tomalski was a regular contributor to"" You and Yours"" and"" The Big Byte"" on BBC Radio. He also broadcast for Radio Mercury and Radio Invicta( which also sparked the career of Steve Walsh), and was the resident' Inspector Gadget' on the LBC"" Weekend Wireless Show"", talking about the week's technology news, reviewing gadgets and answering listener queries.

3-inch gun M1903
The 3-inch gun M1917 was a World War I-era US-made anti-aircraft gun based on the 3-inch gun M1903. It was designed for a fixed mounting and remained in service, primarily at Coast Artillery installations, through World War II. It was determined that the weapon was too heavy and had too much recoil for mobile mountings, so a new weapon based on the lighter and less powerful 3-inch gun M1898 was developed, designated the 3-inch Gun M1918. This was the standard US anti-aircraft gun until replaced by the 3-inch gun M3 in 1930. There is some controversy as to whether any seacoast guns were actually converted into anti-aircraft guns in the development of these weapons.

Tai-Pan is a 1986 adventure drama film directed by Daryl Duke, loosely based on James Clavell's 1966 eponymous novel. While many of the same characters and plot twists are maintained, a few smaller occurrences are left out. Filmed under communist Chinese censorship, some portions of Clavell's story were considered too offensive to be filmed as written and considerable changes were made. The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group handled the production and were actively seen battling the Chinese Government and Labor boards over the film during shooting. The results fared poorly at the box office and in critical reviews. Duke believed that a mini-series à la Shōgun or Noble House would have been a far superior means of covering the complexity of Clavell's novel.

Rear Window Captioning System
The Rear Window captioning system( RWC) is a method for presenting, through captions, a transcript of the audio portion of a film in theatres for deaf and hard- of- hearing people. The system was co-developed by WGBH and Rufus Butler Seder. On the way into the theatre, viewers pick up a reflective plastic panel mounted on a flexible stalk. The panel sits in a seat cupholder or on the floor adjacent to the seat. A large LED display is mounted on a rear wall that displays caption characters in mirror image. Viewers move the panels into position( usually below the movie screen) so they can read the reflected captions and watch the movie. It is sometimes necessary to sit in a certain area of the theater to obtain the best angle for reflecting the backward text emitted from the back of the theater on the panel while also being able to view the movie at the same time. Through this method, all screenings of a film can be accessible to caption viewers. Others seated alongside do not watch, or usually even see, the captions. Rear Window captioning is an alternative to open captioning, in which text is permanently visible. Open captioning has been little- used due to the fear that it was too intrusive and noticeable to hearing viewers. However, no studies have been conducted to elicit hearing people's opinions on how they will adapt to reading captions on screen. Rear Window captioning is a form of closed captioning because the viewer must choose to view the captions. Few movie exhibitors or theater chains choose to provide Rear Window captioning. One of the reasons often stated for not providing Rear Window captioning is the cost of the hardware( as of 2011, approximately US$ 4,500 per screen for a single installation, less for multiple installations in a multiplex). The cost of captioning a film is on the order of US$ 4,000( about$ 40 per minute). For blind viewers, audio description( Descriptive Video Service, DVS) can be and usually is transmitted along with captions. Viewers listen to the descriptions via wireless headsets. In the Rear Window system, the film print is unaffected. With the transition to Digital Cinema, closed captions are included in many digital cinema packages. In many movie advertisements by a specific cinema, the"" RWC"" acronym is often used, much like the CC acronym is used to indicate the availability of closed captions on television shows. Often,"" RWC/ DVS"" notation is used, indicating the availability of both Rear Window Captioning and Descriptive Video Service.

There was much evidence of official conciliation toward Islam in Russia in the 1990s. The number of Muslims allowed to make pilgrimages to Mecca increased sharply after the embargo of the Soviet era ended in 1991.

The Union of Muslims of Russia is the direct successor to the pre-World War I Union of Muslims, which had its own faction in the Russian Duma. The post-Communist union formed a political party, the Nur All-Russia Muslim Public Movement, which acts in close coordination with Muslim imams to defend the political, economic, and cultural rights of Muslims. The Islamic Cultural Center of Russia, which includes a madrassa (religious school), opened in Moscow in 1991. In the 1990s, the number of Islamic publications has increased. Among them are few magazines in Russian, namely: ""Ислам"" (transliteration: Islam), ""Эхо Кавказа"" (Ekho Kavkaza) and ""Исламский вестник"" (Islamsky Vestnik), and the Russian-language newspaper ""Ассалам"" (Assalam), and ""Нуруль Ислам"" (Nurul Islam), which are published in Makhachkala, Dagestan.

Although Hey sometimes described themselves as the first Polish grunge band, their melodic, guitar- driven rock and eclectic appearance owed more to new wave and heavy metal influences; their first three albums contained songs in both Polish and English. During the band's mid-1990s heyday, they sold out stadiums throughout Poland, and attempted to break into the English- language market with a series of concerts overseas and an English version of their 1995 album. When this failed to arouse interest, the band began to write in Polish only, and gradually adopted a harder- edged, more industrial- influenced sound. Overall, the band has sold over 2.2 million album copies. In addition, Nosowska has also enjoyed a successful career as a solo artist. She has released six solo albums that derive more from an electronica style.

Doña Carlota Joaquina of Spain (""Carlota Joaquina Teresa Cayetana""; 25 April 1775 – 7 January 1830), was by birth a member of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon and Infanta of Spain and by marriage Queen consort of Portugal. Eldest daughter of King Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma, she was married in May 1785 aged 10 with Infante John, Lord of the Infantado and Duke of Beja, second son of Queen Maria I of Portugal, in an attempt to cement ties between the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal. Detested by the Portuguese court — where she was called ""the Shrew of Queluz""  — Carlota Joaquina also gradually won the antipathy of the people, who accused her of promiscuity and influencing her husband in favor of the interests of the Spanish crown. After the escape of the Portuguese court to Brazil, Carlota Joaquina began conspiring against her husband, claiming that he had no mental capacity to govern Portugal and its possessions, thus wanting to establish a regency. Ambitious, she also planned to usurp the Spanish crown that was in the hands of Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte. After the marriage in 1817 of her son Pedro with the Archduchess Leopoldina of Austria and the later return of the royal family to Portugal in 1821, Carlota Joaquina was confined in the Royal Palace of Queluz, where she died alone and abandoned by her children on 7 January 1830. After her death, Carlota Joaquina (mainly in Brazil) became part of popular culture and an important historical figure, being the subject of several books, films and other media. Some scholars believe that she has had a rough and superficial behavior, attributing to her the fact that she hated Brazil.

Quintus Salvidienus Rufus
Quintus Salvidienus Rufus was a Roman general and one of the closest advisors of Caesar Octavian during the early years of his political activity. Despite his humble origin, he was one of Octavian ’s best friends, along with Marcus Agrippa. Salvidienus and Agrippa were with Octavian at Apollonia in March 44 BC when Julius Caesar was assassinated in Rome. Salvidienus became one of the most trusted of Octavian ’s generals during the civil wars following Caesar ’s death. In 42 BC he commanded the fleet of Octavian against Sextus Pompeius, who had taken control of Sicily and was harassing the coasts of Italy. However, Salvidienus was defeated in a naval battle fought off Rhegium, largely because of the inexperience of his crews. On Octavian's return from Greece after the Battle of Philippi, Salvidienus was sent to Spain with six legions, but he hastily retreated to Italy to oppose Lucius Antonius and Fulvia( Antony's wife), who had taken up arms against Octavian, starting the so- called Perusian War. Salvidienus captured and destroyed the city of Sentinum and then, with Agrippa, surrounded Lucius Antonius's forces in Perusia. The other Antonian generals, who had no clear orders from Antony, remained out of the struggle, and Lucius Antonius was forced to surrender after a few months' siege( winter of 40 BC). After the end of the Perusian War, Octavian sent Salvidienus to Gaul as a governor, with a large army of eleven legions. He was also designated as consul for 39 BC, although he had not reached senatorial rank. Despite all these honours, when Antony came from the East with large forces to confront Octavian, Salvidienus offered to desert to Antony with his legions. Apparently this proposal came after Antony had already made an agreement with Octavian( the Pact of Brundisium). Antony revealed to Octavian the treachery of Salvidienus, who was accused of high treason in the Senate and condemned to death in the fall of 40 BC. He was either executed or committed suicide, as reported by Appian, Livy, and Dio.

Dolores del Río
Dolores del Río (born María de los Dolores Asúnsolo López-Negrete; 3 August 1905 – 11 April 1983) was a Mexican actress of film, television, and theater. With a career spanning more than 50 years, she is regarded as the first major female Latin American crossover star in Hollywood, with an outstanding career in American films in the 1920s and 1930s. She was also considered one of the most important female figures in the Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. del Río is also remembered as one of the most beautiful faces of the cinema in her time. After being discovered in Mexico, she began her film career in the American cinema in 1925. She had roles in a series of successful films among those who stand out ""Resurrection"" (1927), ""Ramona"" (1928) and ""Evangeline"" (1929). Del Río came to be considered a sort of feminine version of Rudolph Valentino, a ""female Latin Lover"" in her years in American silent movies. With the advent of sound, she acted in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas, musical comedies and romantic dramas. Among her most successful films of that decade include ""Bird of Paradise"" (1932), ""Flying Down to Rio"" (1933) and ""Madame Du Barry"" (1934). In the early 1940s, when her Hollywood career began to decline, del Río returned to Mexico and joined the Mexican film industry, which at that time was at its peak. When del Río returned to her native country, she became one of the more important stars of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. A series of Mexican films starring del Rio, are considered classic masterpieces and helped boost Mexican cinema worldwide. Of them stands out the critically acclaimed ""Maria Candelaria"" (1943). Del Río remained active mainly in Mexican films throughout the 1950s. In 1960 she returned to Hollywood. During the next years she appeared in Mexican and American films. From the late 1950s until the early 1970s she also successfully ventured into theater in Mexico and appeared in some American television series. Del Río is considered a mythical figure of cinema in Latin America and a quintessential representation of the female face of Mexico in the entire world.

Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid is a 1982 neo-noir comedy-mystery film directed by Carl Reiner. Starring Steve Martin and Rachel Ward, the film is both a parody of and a homage to ""film noir"" and the pulp detective movies of the 1940s.

Economic effects of Brexit
Most economists, including the UK Treasury, argue that being in the EU has a strong positive effect on trade and as a result the UK's trade would be worse off if it left the EU. Surveys of leading economists show overwhelming agreement that Brexit will likely reduce the UK's real per - capita income level. A 2017 survey of existing academic literature found ``the research literature displays a broad consensus that in the long run Brexit will make the United Kingdom poorer because it will create new barriers to trade, foreign direct investment, and immigration. However, there is substantial uncertainty over how large the effect will be, with plausible estimates of the cost ranging between 1 and 10 percent of the UK's income per capita. ''These estimates differ depending on whether the UK stays in the European Single Market (for instance, by joining the EEA), makes a free trade agreement with the EU, or reverts to the trade rules that govern relations between all World Trade Organization members. Prior to the referendum, the UK treasury estimated that leaving the EU would be bad for the UK's trade.

Hayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of growth theory, information economics, and the theory of spontaneous order.

Daniel Santbech( fl. 1561) was a Dutch mathematician and astronomer. He adopted the Latinized name of Noviomagus, possibly suggesting that he came from the town of Nijmegen, called"" Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum"" by the Romans. In 1561, Santbech compiled a collected edition of the works of Regiomontanus( 1436 – 1476),"" De triangulis planis et sphaericis libri quinque""( first published in 1533) and"" Compositio tabularum sinum recto"", as well as Santbech's own"" Problematum astronomicorum et geometricorum sectiones septem"". It was published in Basel by Henrich Petri and Petrus Perna. Santbech's work consisted of studies on astronomy, sundials, surveying, and levelling for water courses. It also includes descriptions of astronomical instruments, information for navigators and geographers, and general information about astronomy in the first years after Nicolaus Copernicus. Santbech also studied the subject of gunnery and ballistics as a theoretic discourse as well as for the practical application of war, and utilized the foundations of geometry, with ample references to Euclid and Ptolemy, in order to do so. Santbech seem not to have been aware of similar studies by Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia. Santbech's text included theoretical illustrations of trajectories. These were depicted with abruptly acute angles and straight lines, allowing him to create a right- angled triangle from which ranges were computed with the help of a table of sines. Santbech was of course fully aware that a cannonball's true trajectory would not consist of a straight line and a sudden drop, but these depictions were meant to assist with mathematical calculations. In 1651, Riccioli gave Santbech's name to the crater Santbech on the Moon.

William Vane, 1st Viscount Vane (1682 – 20 May 1734), of Fairlawn, Kent, was a British Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1708 and 1734. Vane was baptized on 17 February 1682, the second surviving son of Christopher Vane, 1st Baron Barnard, and his wife Lady Elizabeth Holles, daughter of Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare and sister of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle. He inherited a substantial fortune from his mother's family. In 1703, he married Lucy Jolliffe, daughter of Sir William Jolliffe, of Caverswall Castle, Staffordshire. The settlement dated 15 November 1703 included Fairlawn, Kent, and lands in Durham, providing Vane with £600 p.a. for himself and his wife. After the marriage, Vane's father refused to include Fairlawn in the settlement, and took ‘great displeasure’ and stopped the allowance when his son took legal advice. The case came before the House of Lords and the settlement was confirmed. Vane kept possession of Fairlawn. At the 1708 British general election, Vane was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for County Durham on his father's interest. He was active as a teller for various electoral disputes and voted for the naturalization of the Palatines, and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. At the 1710 British general election, his father decided to drop him, so he did not stand. In 1720 Vane was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Vane, of Dungannon in the County of Tyrone, and Viscount Vane. These titles did not disqualify him from sitting in the House of Commons. He succeeded his father in 1723. At the 1727 British general election Vane was successfully returned in a contest for Steyning. At the 1734 British general election he was defeated at Steyning but returned in a contest as MP for Kent. However, he died suddenly only five days later. Vane died of apoplexy on 20 May 1734 at Fairlawn, Shipbourne, Kent, where he was buried on 5 June. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his only surviving son, William.

Namibia
About half of the population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood, but Namibia must still import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in rural areas and exist on a subsistence way of life. Namibia has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world, due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cash-less economy. The inequality figures thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival. Although arable land accounts for only 1% of Namibia, nearly half of the population is employed in agriculture.

Ancient and medieval Hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts) Each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by each school . The various schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge. For example, the Cārvāka nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge, the Samkhya school holds three are (perception, inference and testimony), while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge.

Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)
"" Do n't Leave Me( Ne Me Quitte Pas)"" is a song by Regina Spektor, from her 2012 album"" What We Saw from the Cheap Seats"". It was released as the album's second single on March 26, 2012. Although a handful of critics assumed this was an English- language cover version of Jacques Brel's song"" Ne me quitte pas"", Spektor ’s song is different in every way except the title. The chord structure, melody, and lyrics are all completely different. Brel ’s song was written in the key of A minor, in 3/ 4 time. It is a slow, haunting story of a man trying to win back his former lover—a song about the cowardice of men according to Brel. In contrast, Spektor ’s song is lively, in 4/ 4 time, and in a major key. Its lyrics evoke a carefree jaunt through various neighborhoods of New York City, the narrator describing all the beautiful and interesting things encountered along the way. Somehow the narrator ends up in the cafés and gardens of Paris, and the song ends with repeated declarations of love for Paris in the rain. The song was previously released on Spektor's 2002 album"" Songs"", simply titled"" Ne Me Quitte Pas"". This version of the song featured just Spektor and her piano, while the 2012 version includes a drum machine, horns and brass instruments. The song also features lyrics sung in both English and French, evident in the title. In June 2012, Spektor released yet another version of the song online, keeping the multi-instrument production heard on"" What We Saw from the Cheap Seats"", but replacing the English verses with Russian lyrics. The new rendition was titled"" Не Покидай Меня"". The song can be heard at the end of the episode"" Five Miles From Yetzer Hara"" from the eighth season of"" Weeds"".

Thuringia
Like most other regions of central and southern Germany, Thuringia has a significant industrial sector reaching back to the mid-19th-century industrialisation. The economic transition after the German reunification in 1990 led to the closure of most large-scale factories and companies, leaving small and medium-sized ones to dominate the manufacturing sector. Well-known industrial centres are Jena (a world centre for optical instruments with companies like Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik) and Eisenach, where BMW started its car production in the 1920s and an Opel factory is based today. The most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking, vehicle production and food industries. Especially the small and mid-sized towns in central and southwestern Thuringia (e.g. Arnstadt, Schmalkalden and Ohrdruf) are highly industrialised, whereas there are fewer industrial companies in the northern and eastern parts of the Land. Traditional industries like production of glass, porcelain and toys collapsed during the economic crises between 1930 and 1990.
