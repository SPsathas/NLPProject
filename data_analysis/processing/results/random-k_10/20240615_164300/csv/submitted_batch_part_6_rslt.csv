Miami
The Miami area has a unique dialect, (commonly called the ""Miami accent"") which is widely spoken. The dialect developed among second- or third-generation Hispanics, including Cuban-Americans, whose first language was English (though some non-Hispanic white, black, and other races who were born and raised the Miami area tend to adopt it as well.) It is based on a fairly standard American accent but with some changes very similar to dialects in the Mid-Atlantic (especially the New York area dialect, Northern New Jersey English, and New York Latino English.) Unlike Virginia Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects and Florida Cracker dialect (see section below), ""Miami accent"" is rhotic; it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish (wherein rhythm is syllable-timed). However, this is a native dialect of English, not learner English or interlanguage; it is possible to differentiate this variety from an interlanguage spoken by second-language speakers in that ""Miami accent"" does not generally display the following features: there is no addition of /ɛ/ before initial consonant clusters with /s/, speakers do not confuse of /dʒ/ with /j/, (e.g., Yale with jail), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as alveolar approximant [ɹ] instead of alveolar tap [ɾ] or alveolar trill [r] in Spanish.

Colonels Mountain (New Brunswick)
Colonels Mountain is a mountain in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. It lies adjacent to Big Bald Mountain, at the headwaters of the Northwest Miramichi River and the Sevogle River. The mountain top has been weathered to generate a series of mushroom- shaped granitic tors. Because the weathering process which forms tors is normally very slow, these features have been interpreted as indicating that part of northern New Brunswick escaped the last, Wisconsinan glaciation. It has been suggested, however, that the mountain lay near the centre of the ice cap; these erosional remnants thus escaped the scouring action of the glaciers.

Saint Issel or Issell( or"" Usyllt"") was a 6th- century Welsh saint from Dyfed principally notable as being the father of Saint Teilo. His name appears in many forms in surviving texts, but seems to have been derived from the Latin name"" Auxilius"". The Book of Llandaff gives his wife as Guenhaf daughter of Liuonui. He was the father of Saint Teilo and the Anauved who married King Budig of Armorica and bore three saints. The oldest genealogies present him as also the father of Saint Cynllo. He was the patron saint of the parish church at Saundersfoot but probably not the patron of Haroldston St Issells which was probably corrupted from an original dedication to his grandson Saint Ismael.

Jonathan Romney of Sight& Sound described the film as"" A shock to the system – an Indian film like I ’d never seen."" The film constantly switches between genre pieces and is part hard- boiled film noir, part love story, part melodrama and part documentary. It has been compared to Rainer Werner Fassbinder ’s"" The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant"", and Wong Kar Wai's"" Chungking Express"". Shot on a combination of Kodak Super 16 and 35 mm film in widescreen, central themes of Miss Lovely include repressed sexuality, censorship, the deconstruction of genre, the material nature of celluloid and the extinction of cinema itself. The film soundtrack also links back to a history of past cinema, particularly the use of rare work of Italian composers Egisto Macchi and Piero Umiliani, who had both scored exploitation films. The soundtrack also employs film scores by Indian composer Ilaiyaraaja and disco producer Biddu. Miss Lovely competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. The film has since screened at numerous film festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival and International Film Festival Rotterdam. Miss Lovely had release of around 300 screens in India on 17 January 2014.

William de Vesci or Vescy (died 1297) was a prominent 13th-century noble. He was a son of William de Vesci and Lady Agnes de Ferrers, daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, and Sibyl Marshal. He founded the Grey Abbey in Kildare, Ireland for the Franciscans in 1260. During the Second Barons' War campaign of 1265, William held Gloucester Castle against Prince Edward. He was pardoned afterwards and entered the service of King Henry III of England. He served against the Welsh in 1277 and later in 1282. He was appointed the justice of the forests north of the Trent in 1285. Upon the death of his brother John de Vesci in 1289, William succeeded to the family estates, including as Lord of Sprouston in Scotland. He was also granted the Constable of Scarborough Castle between 1289 until 1292. William was sent with Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham in 1289 to represent King Edward I of England in Scotland. He also founded White Abbey, near Kildare, Ireland for the Carmelites in 1290. Upon the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, William became one of the competitors for the Crown of Scotland, deriving his claim from his grandmother, Margaret, illegitimate daughter of William the Lion and the wife of Eustace fitz John. William's claim was withdrawn on the eve of the King Edward I of England announcing which of the claimants would inherit the throne in 1292. With the death of his mother, Agnes on 11 May 1290, he inherited large estates in Ireland, including the franchise of the County Kildare with Kildare Castle and Rathangan Castle. On 12 September 1290, William was appointed Lord Justice in Ireland by King Edward I of England. His service was interrupted by complaints with William entering the king's court in 1293 and 1294 to answer charges against him. Sir John FitzThomas, 4th Lord Offaly, fiercely quarrelled with William over rival claimants of the King of Connaught. FitzThomas made claims to King Edward I of England that William had accused the king of cowardice during the siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, and was organising a rebellion against the king. William lost his position as Lord Justice. William attempted to sue FitzThomas for defamation before the council at Dublin. King Edward I summoned all the parties to Westminster, however, FitzThomas did not appear, and although William requested for a judgment in his favour by reason of the default, this was not allowed, with the matter finally being resolved during the parliament in August 1295. He was summoned to Parliament as a baron in 1295. While he regained the king's favour, William did not regain his position of Lord Justice in Ireland, however was restored to his former position as justiciar of the forests beyond Trent. He was sent to Gascony in December 1295 on the king's service. William surrendered his lands of Kildare in 1297 on condition of his and his brother's debts to the exchequer being forgiven. Edward I regranted his lands in Kildare for life only. William also resigned Malton Castle and his Yorkshire estates to Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, however he received them back for life and entailed after his death on his illegitimate son and his heirs. He also placed in charge of Alnwick Castle to Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham on trust, to restore it to his illegitimate son when he became of age. Soon afterwards William died in 1297.

William X, Duke of Aquitaine
William X (Guillém X in Occitan) (1099 – 9 April 1137), called the Saint, was Duke of Aquitaine, Duke of Gascony, and Count of Poitou (as William VIII) from 1126 to 1137. He was the son of William IX by his second wife, Philippa of Toulouse. William was born in Toulouse during the brief period when his parents ruled the capital. His birth is recorded in the ""Chronicle of Saint-Maixent"" for the year 1099: ""Willelmo comiti natus est filius, equivoce Guillelmus vocatusa son was born to Count William, named William like himself""). Later that same year, much to Philippa's ire, Duke William IX mortgaged Toulouse to Philippa's cousin, Bertrand of Toulouse, and then left on Crusade.
Philippa and her infant son William X were left in Poitiers. When Duke William IX returned from his unsuccessful crusade, he took up with Dangerose, the wife of a vassal, and set aside his rightful wife, Philippa. This caused strain between father and son, until 1121 when William X married Aenor de Châtellerault, a daughter of his father's mistress Dangerose by her first husband, Aimery. William had three children with Aenor: He possibly had one natural son, William. For a long time it was thought that he had another natural son called Joscelin and some biographies still erroneously state this fact, but Joscelin has been shown to be the brother of Adeliza of Louvain. The attribution of Joscelin as a son of William X has been caused by a mistaken reading of the Pipe Rolls pertaining to the reign of Henry II, where 'brother of the queen' has been taken as Queen Eleanor, when the queen in question is actually Adeliza of Louvain. William administered his Aquitaine duchy as both a lover of the arts and a warrior. He became involved in conflicts with Normandy (which he raided in 1136, in alliance with Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou who claimed it in his wife's name) and for France. Even inside his borders, William faced an alliance of the Lusignans and the Parthenays against him, an issue resolved with total destruction of the enemies. In international politics, William X initially supported antipope Anacletus II in the papal schism of 1130, opposite to Pope Innocent II, against the will of his own bishops. In 1134 Saint Bernard of Clairvaux convinced William to drop his support to Anacletus and join Innocent. In 1137 William joined the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, but died during the trip. On his deathbed, he expressed his wish to see king Louis VI of France as protector of his fifteen-year-old daughter Eleanor, and to find her a suitable husband. Louis VI naturally accepted this guardianship and married the heiress of Aquitaine to his own son, Louis VII.

This was in conjunction with a campaign of Donnchad Midi versus Leinster and may have been part of that or Donnchad may have defeated the men of southern Brega on is way home. Coirpre then reappears in the year 771 at his death obit with the title King of Brega.

Luigi Luraschi
Luigi Luraschi (January 7, 1906 – March 31, 2002) was a lifelong executive for Paramount Pictures who initially served as head of the studio's Domestic and Foreign Censorship Department, before spending most of the remainder of his tenure overseas, supervising both European releases of their American films as well as foreign-based productions such as ""The Conformist"". Luraschi was born in London at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital to Guiditta Luraschi, a native of Appiano Gentile; he was never told his father's identity. His stepfather, Genaro San Sevarino, was a restaurateur. Luraschi attended Catholic school in his childhood, and was later educated in Swiss and German boarding schools. He initially followed in his stepfather's trade, joining him in moving to the Italian Riviera to help him run a hotel catering to American tourists. Upon the recommendation of several of his American customers, Luraschi moved to America to seek work. However, he arrived in New York City during the summer of 1929, soon before the infamous ""Black Tuesday"" when the Wall Street Crash of 1929 put thousands out of work, and initially was unable to find a job. "" While walking on 7th Avenue wondering what I could do to earn a living, I ran into a school chum from Switzerland. His mother was a theatrical agent who had an Italian novel called ""Death Takes a Holiday"". She needed to have it translated. I took the job and got [paid] for my work. Paramount Pictures bought the novel. At the same time they hired me to do the sub-titles for all their films for foreign release. In fact, I helped to invent the technology for talking pictures with sub-titles. This was in New York. I became the head of operations for subtitles for Paramount Pictures, New York."" He was soon transferred to Paramount's Hollywood offices, where he established an international division to handle inquiries from foreign publications, and supervise foreign-based productions. Luraschi also served in a much quieter role as a frequent overseer of content in films released by Paramount. In the buildup and entry into World War II, he warned against inserting content into films that could have repercussions on Jews overseas; when Paramount produced ""The Hitler Gang"" in 1944, he alerted the studio that in one test screening, audiences were applauding anti-Semitic statements made in the film. The film scholar David N. Eldridge proposes that Luraschi, writing under the pseudonym Owen, later became a frequent correspondent with the Central Intelligence Agency, both informing them of political activities of studio talent while taking advice from them to place positive American imagery in films made at Paramount. Suggestions, such as depicting African-Americans in dignified roles to counter foreign propaganda about American race issues, or making sure American characters in foreign locales were respectful of local mores. Luraschi also reportedly claimed to have seen a naked breast during the shower scene of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" when it was previewed for studio brass, though Hitchcock insisted he only imagined it. Luraschi spent the '60's shuttling between Europe and the States, initially collaborating with Dino De Laurentiis on Italian-based productions for Paramount in Rome, then acting as assistant to president of production George Weltner in New York, then transferring to Paris to supervise production of Rene Clement's ""Is Paris Burning?"". Luraschi was ultimately established in Rome at Mars Film Produzione, an Italian production outfit seeded by Paramount, in 1967, where he would greenlight films produced for Germany, France, Italy and Spain, and handle the release of American films in those territories. He also became VP of international production for Paramount's London offices, and often was in charge of foreign-language dubbing on behalf of their shared European distribution venture Cinema International Corporation. He retired from studio activity in 1994 at age 88. He died of natural causes in Paris at the age of 96. He had two children. His son, Tony Luraschi, directed the IRA thriller ""The Outsider"", which was released by Paramount in 1980. His daughter Judy Starbuck Sorro is an artist and works for the city of San Francisco. He has 5 grandchildren. His grandson Tony Starbuck is a sound mixer based in New York. His grandson Joshua Starbuck is a lighting designer based in New York. His granddaughter Savanna Luraschi is a fashion executive an ordained Buddhist nun based in New York. His grandson Clay Luraschi is an executive with Topps based in New York. His grandson David Luraschi is a photographer based in Paris.

1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania
The 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania was an oral ultimatum which Joachim von Ribbentrop, Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany, presented to Juozas Urbšys, Foreign Minister of Lithuania on 20 March 1939. The Germans demanded that Lithuania give up the Klaipėda Region (also known as the Memel Territory) which had been detached from Germany after World War I, or the Wehrmacht would invade Lithuania. The Lithuanians had been expecting the demand after years of rising tension between Lithuania and Germany, increasing pro-Nazi propaganda in the region, and continued German expansion. It was issued just five days after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. The 1924 Klaipėda Convention had guaranteed the protection of the status quo in the region, but the four signatories to that convention did not offer any material assistance. The United Kingdom and France followed a policy of appeasement, while Italy and Japan openly supported Germany, and Lithuania was forced to accept the ultimatum on 22 March. It proved to be the last territorial acquisition for Germany before World War II, producing a major downturn in Lithuania's economy and escalating pre-war tensions for Europe as a whole.

John Calvin bibliography
At the age of twenty - six, Calvin published the first edition of his Institutes of the Christian Religion (Latin title: Institutio Christianae Religionis), a seminal work in Christian theology that is still read by theological students today. It was published in Latin in 1536 and in his native French in 1541, with the definitive editions appearing in 1559 (Latin) and in 1560 (French). The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant faith for those with some learning already and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of church and sacraments to justification by faith alone and Christian liberty, and it vigorously attacked the teachings of those Calvin considered unorthodox, particularly Roman Catholicism to which Calvin says he had been ``strongly devoted ''before his conversion to Protestantism. The overarching theme of the book -- and Calvin's greatest theological legacy -- is the idea of God's total sovereignty, particularly in salvation and election.

Princess Uliana Olshanska (or) was a noblewoman from the Olshanski family, the second wife of Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. They had no issue. Very little is known about Uliana's life. Her first husband was Ivan of Karachev. German chronicle of Johann von Posilge and Polish historian Jan Długosz asserted that Ivan was murdered so that widowed Uliana could marry Vytautas. Most likely she was an Eastern Orthodox who converted to Catholicism in order to marry Vytautas. After the death of his first wife Anna on 31 July 1418, Vytautas wished to marry Uliana, daughter of one of his closest allies Ivan Olshansky. However, Anna was sister of Agripina, who was wife of Ivan and mother of Uliana. That made Vytautas uncle-in-law of Uliana. Piotr Krakowczyk, Bishop of Vilnius, refused to perform the wedding ceremony due to this relationship and demanded they seek approval from the pope. Jan Kropidło, Bishop of Włocławek, performed the ceremony before Christmas 1418 and, eventually, Vytautas obtained a matrimonial dispensation from Pope Martin V. It appears that the marriage was a loving one, but they had no children. Vytautas died in October 1430 and Uliana's further life is unknown.

He was raised in the Caucasus, where he lived between 1862 and 1881 with his family, and was educated by private tutors. As Romanov tradition demanded, he followed a military career. He served in the Russo-Turkish War in 1877, became a Colonel and was adjutant at the Imperial court. In 1891 he contracted a morganatic marriage with Countess Sophie von Merenberg, a morganatic daughter of Prince Nicholas William of Nassau and a granddaughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. For contracting this marriage without permission, Emperor Alexander III of Russia, stripped him of his military titles and banished the couple from Russia. For some years he lived in Wiesbaden, Nassau and in Cannes. He settled permanently in England in 1900, leasing Keele Hall in Staffordshire and later Kenwood House on the outskirts of London. He became a prominent member of British society, one of his daughters marrying into the British aristocracy and another marrying a great-grandson of Queen Victoria. He lost his fortune with the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1918. Three of his brothers were killed by the Bolsheviks, but he escaped the Russian Revolution because he was living abroad. He spent his last years living under reduced circumstances with the financial help of his son-in-law Sir Harold Wernher.

Queen Victoria
Victoria was physically unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy and no more than five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date.

Hellenistic period
Other city states formed federated states in self-defense, such as the Aetolian League (est. 370 BCE), the Achaean League (est. 280 BCE), the Boeotian league, the ""Northern League"" (Byzantium, Chalcedon, Heraclea Pontica and Tium) and the ""Nesiotic League"" of the Cyclades. These federations involved a central government which controlled foreign policy and military affairs, while leaving most of the local governing to the city states, a system termed sympoliteia. In states such as the Achaean league, this also involved the admission of other ethnic groups into the federation with equal rights, in this case, non-Achaeans. The Achean league was able to drive out the Macedonians from the Peloponnese and free Corinth, which duly joined the league.

Under stjernerne på himlen
""Under stjernerne på himlenUnder the stars of the sky"") was the Danish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993, performed in Danish by the Tommy Seebach Band. Seebach wrote the song as a lullaby to his daughter, and his family encouraged him to suggest it as a finalist for the Danish final in 1993, where it won. At the Eurovision Song Contest, the song was performed fifth on the night, following Switzerland's Annie Cotton with ""Moi, tout simplement"" and preceding Greece's Katerina Garbi with ""Ellada, Hora Tou Fotos"". At the close of voting, it had received 9 points, placing 22nd in a field of 25. The disappointing result at this Contest, coupled with the expansion of the Contest following the collapse of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, meant that Denmark was relegated from competing in the 1994 contest, causing them to miss a finale for the first time since 1977. The media reacted poorly to this, putting the blame on Seebach personally, which his son later revealed was one of the main reasons for his father's descent into alcoholism and depression, which led to his divorce and ultimately his early death ten years later. Although Seebach had become sober at the time, the many years of heavy drinking had caused permanently damaged his heart, which led to the deadly heart attack in 2003. ""Under stjernerne på himlen"" was played at Seebach's funeral, as the coffin was carried out of the church. It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1995 Contest (to which Denmark had been invited) by Aud Wilken with ""Fra Mols til Skagen"".

Sanskrit
For nearly 2000 years, Sanskrit was the language of a cultural order that exerted influence across South Asia, Inner Asia, Southeast Asia, and to a certain extent East Asia. A significant form of post-Vedic Sanskrit is found in the Sanskrit of Indian epic poetry—the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The deviations from Pāṇini in the epics are generally considered to be on account of interference from Prakrits, or innovations, and not because they are pre-Paninian. Traditional Sanskrit scholars call such deviations ārṣa (आर्ष), meaning 'of the ṛṣis', the traditional title for the ancient authors. In some contexts, there are also more ""prakritisms"" (borrowings from common speech) than in Classical Sanskrit proper. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit is a literary language heavily influenced by the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, based on early Buddhist Prakrit texts which subsequently assimilated to the Classical Sanskrit standard in varying degrees.

Cyprus
Cyprus was placed under British administration based on Cyprus Convention in 1878 and formally annexed by Britain in 1914. Even though Turkish Cypriots made up only 18% of the population, the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s. Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an ""extension of Anatolia"" by them; while since the 19th century, the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece, which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s. Following nationalist violence in the 1950s, Cyprus was granted independence in 1960. In 1963, the 11-year intercommunal violence between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots started, which displaced more than 25,000 Turkish Cypriots and brought the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the republic. On 15 July 1974, a coup d'état was staged by Greek Cypriot nationalists and elements of the Greek military junta in an attempt at enosis, the incorporation of Cyprus into Greece. This action precipitated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed, and the displacement of over 150,000 Greek Cypriots and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots. A separate Turkish Cypriot state in the north was established in 1983. These events and the resulting political situation are matters of a continuing dispute.

Joan of Arc
Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc ; 1412 – 30 May 1431), nicknamed ""The Maid of Orléans"" , is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Lancastrian phase of the Hundred Years' War, and was canonized as a Roman Catholic saint. She was born to Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Romée, a peasant family, at Domrémy in northeast France. Joan claimed to have received visions of the archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to support Charles VII and recover France from English domination late in the Hundred Years' War. The unanointed King Charles VII sent Joan to the Siege of Orléans as part of a relief army. She gained prominence after the siege was lifted only nine days later. Several additional swift victories led to Charles VII's consecration at Reims. This long-awaited event boosted French morale and paved the way for the final French victory. On 23 May 1430, she was captured at Compiègne by the Burgundian faction, a group of French nobles allied with the English. She was later handed over to the English and put on trial by the pro-English bishop Pierre Cauchon on a variety of charges. After Cauchon declared her guilty, she was burned at the stake on 30 May 1431, dying at about nineteen years of age. In 1456, an inquisitorial court authorized by Pope Callixtus III examined the trial, debunked the charges against her, pronounced her innocent, and declared her a martyr. In the 16th century she became a symbol of the Catholic League, and in 1803 she was declared a national symbol of France by the decision of Napoleon Bonaparte. She was beatified in 1909 and canonized in 1920. Joan of Arc is one of the nine secondary patron saints of France, along with Saint Denis, Saint Martin of Tours, Saint Louis, Saint Michael, Saint Rémi, Saint Petronilla, Saint Radegund and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Joan of Arc has remained a popular figure in literature, painting, sculpture, and other cultural works since the time of her death, and many famous writers, playwrights, filmmakers, artists, and composers have created, and continue to create, cultural depictions of her.

Film speed
The Standard Output Sensitivity (SOS) technique, also new in the 2006 version of the standard, effectively specifies that the average level in the sRGB image must be 18% gray plus or minus 1/3 stop when the exposure is controlled by an automatic exposure control system calibrated per ISO 2721 and set to the EI with no exposure compensation. Because the output level is measured in the sRGB output from the camera, it is only applicable to sRGB images—typically JPEG—and not to output files in raw image format. It is not applicable when multi-zone metering is used.

This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and low end of the iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9 GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost - cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum / glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.

Nutrition
In the 1500s, Paracelsus was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly. Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci compared metabolism to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen. Ultimately, 16th century works of Andreas Vesalius, sometimes called the father of modern medicine, overturned Galen's ideas. He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide, performed the first quantitative experiment. Robert Boyle advanced chemistry. Sanctorius measured body weight. Physician Herman Boerhaave modeled the digestive process. Physiologist Albrecht von Haller worked out the difference between nerves and muscles.

"" America Drinks& Goes Home"" is a song written by Frank Zappa and recorded in 1967 for the Mothers of Invention album"" Absolutely Free"". The song actually appears in two different versions on the album at the beginning of side 2 under the title"" America Drinks"" and finishing at the end of side 2 under the title"" America Drinks& Goes Home"". In between these songs is a sequence containing"" Status Back BabyUncle Bernie's FarmSon of Suzy Creamcheese"" and"" Brown Shoes Do n't Make It"". Zappa's title for the entire piece was"" Suite No. 2: The M.O.I. American Pageant( 2nd in a Series of Underground Oratorios)"". The piece was performed many times during the Mothers of Invention residency at the Garrick Theater in Greenwich Village in New York City during 1967. Zappa wrote the song to parody his experiences playing with drunken lounge music bands in the early 1960s. The song combines a trite love song lyric with an equally cliched melody. In a radio interview Zappa also described the ii – V– I progression chord changes in this song as a"" satire"" of Jazz chord changes in that they go in unexpected or wrong directions. The members of The Mothers perform the song in a very sloppy way on purpose. Sound effects were creatively added to the recording to give it an authentic nightclub feel. At the end of the recording the audience sounds devolve into screams as lead vocalist Ray Collins says good night to the audience and tells them to"" drink it up, folks."" Soon after the song was released in early 1967 a few other songs appeared which used very similar ideas such as"" On with the Show"" by The Rolling Stones( released in 1967),"" My Friend"" by Jimi Hendrix( recorded in 1968, released in 1971) and"" You Know My Name( Look Up the Number)"" by The Beatles( recorded in 1967 and 1969, released in 1970.)

History of Federal Open Market Committee actions
The Federal Open Market Committee action known as Operation Twist (named for the twist dance craze of the time) began in 1961. The intent was to flatten the yield curve in order to promote capital inflows and strengthen the dollar. The Fed utilized open market operations to shorten the maturity of public debt in the open market. It performs the 'twist' by selling some of the short term debt (with three years or less to maturity) it purchased as part of the quantitative easing policy back into the market and using the money received from this to buy longer term government debt. Although this action was marginally successful in reducing the spread between long - term maturities and short - term maturities, Vincent Reinhart and others have suggested it did not continue for a sufficient period of time to be effective. Despite being considered a failure since a 1966 near - term analysis by Franco Modigliani and Richard Sutch, the action has subsequently been reexamined and in a 2011 paper economist Eric Swanson of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has suggested that ``Operation Twist ''was more effective than originally thought. Swanson suggested similar action as an alternative to quantitative easing by central banks; the FOMC did in fact take an analogous action in 2011.

Symphony, K. 45b (Mozart)
This work was only known to Ludwig Ritter von Köchel as an incipit in the catalogue of Breitkopf & Härtel, and thus it was placed in the Anhang as K. Anh. 214. Alfred Einstein then discovered a set of parts in the Berlin State Library with the title """"Synfonia Ex Bb...Del Sigr. cavaliere Amadeo Wolfgango Mozart Maestro di concerto di S.A. á Salisburgo"""". Wolfgang became the Concertmaster to the Archbishop of Salzburg in November 1769, and was given the title ""cavaliere"" in July 1770, but as this is a later copy, this information cannot be used for dating purposes. Einstein believed the symphony to date from early 1768 on stylistic grounds; Neal Zaslaw and Gerhard Allroggen believe even earlier dates to also be possible, and Zaslaw dated the symphony cautiously to Salzburg in 1767. Einstein also believed that the symphonies in the catalogue of Breitkopf & Härtel were sent by Leopold Mozart to be published.

Akbar
Abu'l- Fath Jalal- ud- din Muhammad Akbar( Persian:; October 1542 – 27 October 1605), popularly known as Akbar the Great,("" Akbar- i- azam""), and also as Akbar I, was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to 1605. Akbar succeeded his father, Humayun, under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in India. A strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include most of the Indian subcontinent. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strove to unite far- flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through an Indo- Persian culture, to himself as an emperor. Mughal India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture. Akbar himself was a patron of art and culture. He was fond of literature, and created a library of over 24,000 volumes written in Sanskrit, Urdu, Persian, Greek, Latin, Arabic and Kashmiri, staffed by many scholars, translators, artists, calligraphers, scribes, bookbinders and readers. He did much of the cataloging himself through three main groupings. Akbar also established the library of Fatehpur Sikri exclusively for women, and he decreed that schools for the education of both Muslims and Hindus should be established throughout the realm. He also encouraged bookbinding to become a high art. Holy men of many faiths, poets, architects, and artisans adorned his court from all over the world for study and discussion. Akbar's courts at Delhi, Agra, and Fatehpur Sikri became centres of the arts, letters, and learning. Perso- Islamic culture began to merge and blend with indigenous Indian elements, and a distinct Indo- Persian culture emerged characterized by Mughal style arts, painting, and architecture. Disillusioned with orthodox Islam and perhaps hoping to bring about religious unity within his empire, Akbar promulgated Din-i -Ilahi, a syncretic creed derived mainly from Islam and Hinduism as well as some parts of Zoroastrianism and Christianity. Akbar's reign significantly influenced the course of Indian history. During his rule, the Mughal Empire tripled in size and wealth. He created a powerful military system and instituted effective political and social reforms. By abolishing the sectarian tax on non-Muslims and appointing them to high civil and military posts, he was the first Mughal ruler to win the trust and loyalty of the native subjects. He had Sanskrit literature translated, participated in native festivals, realising that a stable empire depended on the co-operation and good- will of his subjects. Thus, the foundations for a multicultural empire under Mughal rule were laid during his reign. Akbar was succeeded as emperor by his son, Prince Salim, later known as Jahangir.

Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset
Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset (18 March 1589 – 28 March 1624) was the son of Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset. Born at Charterhouse, London, Sackville was styled Lord Buckhurst from 1608 until 1609, when he succeeded his father as Earl of Dorset and inherited the family home of Knole House. During the years 1612–24 Sackville served as a Lord Lieutenant of Sussex. Sackville is perhaps best remembered as the first husband of Lady Anne Clifford. They married on 27 February 1609, but their marriage was not a success; partisans of the Earl tended to blame Lady Anne's powerful personality, while partisans of the Countess pointed to the Earl's repeated infidelities, not to mention his extravagance and indebtedness – ""one of the seventeenth century’s most accomplished gamblers and wastrels"". A rumor noted later by the antiquary John Aubrey had it that one of Richard Sackville's ""concubines"" was Venetia Stanley. She was said to have had children by him and he settled upon her an annuity of £500 per annum. Among the Earl's other mistresses was Martha Penistone, the wife of Sir Thomas Penistone, one of the Earl's retinue. At the time of their marriage, Lady Anne had been in a long-running legal contest over her inheritance rights; in 1617, the 3rd Earl signed away her claim on contested ancestral lands to James I, in return for a cash payment which the Earl used to pay off his gambling debts. The 3rd Earl and Lady Anne had five children between 1612 and 1621; however none of their three sons, born in 1616, 1618, and 1621, survived their father. Their two daughters, Isabella (born 6 October 1612, died 22 August 1719) and Margaret (born 2 July 1614, died May 1676) were longer lived. Margaret became the wife of John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet. The 3rd Earl died at Dorset House, London without a male heir on Easter Sunday of 1624 at Dorset House, London, and was succeeded by his younger brother Edward Sackville. He was buried on 7 April 1624 at St. Michael's Parish Church in Withyham, Sussex.

Rocket (Beyoncé song)

It was written by Miguel, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Jerome ""J-Roc"" Harmon and Beyoncé with the group of the latter three people also serving as its producers. Miguel initially conceived the song inspired by Beyoncé, trying to showcase her confidence and sexuality.

""Rocket"" is a slowtempo soul, funk and R&B ballad which was frequently compared to the music of D'Angelo and Prince. It features explicit and metaphorical lyrics discussing frank female sexuality, a prominent theme present on ""Beyoncé"". Lyrically, it sees Beyoncé addressing a male partner through sexual innuendos, adopting soft and sensual vocals. A music video for the song was directed by Beyoncé, Ed Burke and Bill Kirstein and released through ""Beyoncé"" itself on December 13, 2013.

Alexander Schure
Alexander Schure( August 3, 1920- October 29, 2009) was an American academic and entrepreneur. Schure founded the New York Institute of Technology( NYIT) in 1955. He also served as the Chancellor of Nova Southeastern University( NSU) from 1970 until 1985. Schure is credited with saving Nova University, which was in deep financial trouble, after he became the school's chancellor in 1970. The university is now called Nova Southeastern University, and is now the largest private university in Florida, with more than 28,000 students as of 2009. Schure and then- Nova University President Abraham Fischler, Ed.D., formed a federation between Nova and the New York Institute of Technology. The partnership between the two institutions brought money and new programs to Nova University. The money from NYIT allowed Nova University to remain open during its financial difficulties. The alliance between NYIT and Nova University ended in 1985. In November 1974 Schure hired recent University of Utah doctoral graduate Edwin Catmull to direct NYIT's fledgling computer graphics lab, and ensured that the lab received special funding for more than 5 years. Schure was an early champion of computer animation; in 1979 Catmull left to form a computer- graphics group with Lucasfilm and the core technical team- including computer animation pioneers Alvy Ray Smith, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim, Jim Blinn, and Jim Clark- came from the NYIT lab. ( In 1986, that computer- graphics group would be funded by recently fired Steve Jobs as the independent company Pixar which manufactured and sold image- processing computers using the concepts first developed at NYIT, and also produced projects using them.) Although Clark would move on to found Silicon Graphics and Netscape, the rest of the NYIT team continued to play key roles as Pixar's animation developed from its first short films in the mid-1980s onward. It can be said that Dr. Schure's vision and support from 1975 to 1980, and the low- pressure academic research lab environment at NYIT, was an essential contributor to the development of many of the technical innovations needed to produce realistic computer generated films. He funded the computers and frame buffers used in the making of the unfinished computer- generated film"" The Works( film)"". It was also during this time that Schure directed the animated movie Tubby the Tuba( 1975 film). Alexander Schure died from complications of Alzheimer's Disease on Long Island on October 29, 2009, at the age of 89. He was survived by his second wife, Gail; and four children- Dr. Barbara Schure Weinschel, Dr. Matthew Schure, Dr. Jonathan Schure, and Mr. Louis Schure. Following his death, former NSU president Fischler said Schure"" was a brilliant individual with a very creative mind. He was an excellent friend to me and the university. There would be no NSU without him."" He received doctoral degrees in engineering and education from New York University.

Nevado de Longaví
Nevado de Longaví is a volcano in the Andes of central Chile. The high volcano lies in the Linares Province, which is part of the Maule Region. It features a summit crater and several parasitic vents. The volcano is constructed principally from lava flows. Two collapses of the edifice have carved collapse scars into the volcano, one on the eastern slope known as Lomas Limpias and another on the southwestern slope known as Los Bueye. The volcano features a glacier and the Achibueno and Blanco rivers originate on the mountain. The oldest volcanic activity occurred one million years ago. After a first phase characterized by the production of basaltic andesite, the bulk of the edifice was constructed by andesitic lava flows. The volcanic rock that makes up Nevado de Longaví features an unusual magma chemistry that resembles adakite( having geochemical characteristics of magma thought to have formed by partial melting of altered basalt that is subducted below volcanic arcs). It may be the consequence of the magma being unusually water- rich, which may occur because the Mocha fracture zone subducts beneath the volcano. Nevado de Longaví was active during the Holocene. 6,835 ± 65 or 7,500 years before present an explosive eruption deposited pumice more than away from the volcano. A lava flow was then erupted over the pumice. The last eruption occurred about 5,700 years ago and formed a lava dome. The volcano has no historic eruptions but fumarolic activity is ongoing. Nevado de Longaví is monitored by the National Geology and Mining Service of Chile.

Oganesson
Oganesson is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Og and atomic number 118. It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, near Moscow in Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 November 2016. The name is in line with the tradition of honoring a scientist, in this case the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who has played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. It is one of only two elements named after a person who was alive at the time of naming, the other being seaborgium; it is also the only element whose namesake is alive today.Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the nuclide 294Og have been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For example, although oganesson is a member of group 18 – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the noble gases). It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the last one of period 7.

Switzerland
The earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures, named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel. La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from around 450 BC, possibly under some influence from the Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Swiss region was the Helvetii. Steadily harassed by the Germans, in 58 BC the Helvetii decided to abandon the Swiss plateau and migrate to western Gallia, but Julius Caesar's armies pursued and defeated them at the Battle of Bibracte, in today's western France, forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland. In 15 BC, Tiberius, who was destined to be the second Roman emperor and his brother, Drusus, conquered the Alps, integrating them into the Roman Empire. The area occupied by the Helvetii—the namesakes of the later Confoederatio Helvetica—first became part of Rome's Gallia Belgica province and then of its Germania Superior province, while the eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the Roman province of Raetia. Sometime around the start of the Common Era, the Romans maintained a large legionary camp called Vindonissa, now a ruin at the confluence of the Aare and Reuss rivers, near the town of Windisch, an outskirt of Brugg.

Apollo
Homer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans, fighting against the Achaeans, during the Trojan War. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to Appaliunas, a tutelary god of Wilusa (Troy) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete. The stones found in front of the gates of Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo. The Greeks gave to him the name ἀγυιεύς agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column. However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (sibutu) indicates a Babylonian origin.

Salomea of Poland
Salomea of Poland (1211/1212 – 1268), also known as Salomea of Cracow or Blessed Salomea , (1211–1268) was a Polish princess and from 1215 to 1219 the Queen of Halych by virtue of being the wife of Kálmán or Coloman of Galicia. Salomea was the daughter of Leszek I the White, who was the Duke of Kraków and thus the High Duke in Poland, and his wife Grzymisława of Łuck (or Lutsk). She was the older sister of Bolesław V the Chaste. Her marriage to Kálmán, who was the son of King András or Andrew II of Hungary, was negotiated when she was about three. Since her mother had ancestral connections to the lands of Galicia, and both her father and King Andrew wanted to dominate that area, this plan seemed to meet the needs of both parties. The marriage of Salomea and Kálmán, who was seven at the time, occurred in 1215. In 1219 their control in Galicia was ended and for a time they were taken as prisoners. After their release they returned to Hungary and lived in Szepes, now Spiš in the nation of Slovakia. In 1226 Kálmán was named Duke of Slavonia by his father, and he took responsibility for the rule of Slavonia, Croatia, and Dalmatia. He died in 1241 from wounds suffered at the Battle of Mohi during the Mongol invasion of Europe. In 1245 the widowed Salomea joined the Order of Poor Ladies and founded a monastery in Zawichost in which to live as nuns according to the Rule of Saint Clare. Because of the danger of a Mongol invasion into Poland, Salomea and the other Poor Ladies moved westward from Zawichost in March 1257, and relocated to Skała (or Grodzisko), north of Kraków. Salomea was considered saintly and it was said that she had preserved her chastity in marriage. She was beatified in 1672 by Pope Clement X. Her tomb is in Kraków in a chapel within the Church of St. Francis of Assisi.

There is general agreement that the United States has a two - party system; historically, there have been few instances in which third party candidates won an election. In the First Party System, only Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party and Thomas Jefferson's Democratic - Republican Party were significant political parties. Toward the end of the First Party System, the Republicans dominated a one - party system (primarily under the Presidency of James Monroe). Under the Second Party System, the Democratic - Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams' Men and Jackson's Men. In 1828, the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson. The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams. After the National Republicans collapsed, the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed. In 1854, the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs, Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists. Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican president in 1860.

Children of Dreams is a 1931 American pre-Code musical operetta drama film photographed entirely in Part Technicolor and produced and distributed by Warner Bros. The film was directed by Alan Crosland. ""Children of Dreams"" was the second original operetta written especially for the screen by Oscar Hammerstein II and Sigmund Romberg. This team had previously worked on the musical Viennese Nights, which had proved to be a success. The film had the misfortune of being released at a time when the public had grown weary of musicals and did poorly at the box office. It was the only full-scale musical to be released in the summer of 1931. Although ""Children of Dreams"" was filmed in color and exhibited in a few select areas in color, Warner Bros. decided to circulate black-and-white prints in many areas as a cost saving measure due to the backlash against musicals.
