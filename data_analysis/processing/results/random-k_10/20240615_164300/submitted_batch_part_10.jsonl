Originally a literary and political magazine, published at a time when the Bessarabia region was part of Romania , it was founded in 1932 by political activist Pan Halippa and writer Nicolai Costenco. At the time, \"Via\u0163a Basarabiei\" was primarily noted for rejecting the centralism of Greater Romanian governments, to which they opposed more or less vocal Bessarabian regionalist demands and a nativist ethos. Declaring itself to be a traditionalist venue, interested in preserving local specificity in the cultural field, \"Via\u0163a Basarabiei\" was in effect a voice for cultural innovation and a host to modernist writers such as Vladimir Cavarnali, Bogdan Istru or George Meniuc. After the Soviet Union's 1940 annexation of Bessarabia, the editorial board split, and Halippa revived the magazine at a new location in Bucharest.

Under an eventual plea-bargain agreement, Aquino entered a plea of guilty to illegal possession of classified documents, but avoided the more serious charge of espionage that Leandro Aragoncillo received.

Its name is a German abbreviation meaning \u201c Gesellschaft zur INDustrialisierung- RAtionalisierung und AutoMATisierung \u201c( Association for Industrialization, Rationalization, and Automation). The core business was the production of industrial servo drives and motion controls for use on machine tools, machine presses, printing presses, food packaging machinery, as well as assembly lines and material handling equipment. Indramat was acquired by the hydraulic company Rexroth in 1965, for Rexroth to gain competence in machine control.

The name Indramat was no longer used, however Bosch Rexroth Electric Drives and Controls continues to produce and support products originally marketed under the Indramat brand, and newer product families such as the IndraDrive, IndraDyn, and IndraControl are named in recognition of their heritage. In 2001 Indramat employed 1,500, with a turnover of 261 million Euro. Exports constituted 52% of the business.

Invariably playing with thick, round spectacles, the , Mikan is seen as one of the pioneers of professional basketball, redefining it as a game of so-called big men with his prolific rebounding, shot blocking, and his talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot, the result of his namesake Mikan Drill. He also utilized the underhanded free-throw shooting technique long before Rick Barry made it his signature shot. Mikan had a successful playing career, winning seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an NBA All-Star Game MVP trophy, and three scoring titles. He was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games, and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. Mikan was so dominant that he caused several rule changes in the NBA: among them, the introduction of the goaltending rule, the widening of the foul lane\u2014known as the \"Mikan Rule\"\u2014and the creation of the shot clock. After his playing career, Mikan became one of the founders of the American Basketball Association (ABA), serving as commissioner of the league. He was also vital for the forming of the Minnesota Timberwolves. In his later years, Mikan was involved in a long-standing legal battle against the NBA, fighting to increase the meager pensions for players who had retired before the league became lucrative. In 2005, Mikan died after a long battle with diabetes. For his accomplishments, Mikan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980, and was elected one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players ever in 1996.

It is the first Mayhem album with the vocalist Attila Csihar since the 1994 album\" De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" and the last with Blasphemer before he announced his departure from the band in 2008. The drummer, Jan Axel Blomberg( Hellhammer), said that the drum tracks were not equalized and only the bass drums were triggered. He ended saying\" the production sounds necro as fuck, but that's the way we wanted it \u2013 this time. It represents Mayhem today.\" Indeed, the sound of the album is much rawer than that of any official Mayhem studio release since\" Deathcrush\", with a very bass- heavy mix. Despite that, the album continues the somewhat unorthodox songwriting approach showcased on the band's last two releases, with\" Illuminate Eliminate\" being the band's second longest song. Despite being a black metal album, it has some death metal sound. The album includes some death grunts and clean vocals; however,\" Grand Declaration of War\" has cleaner vocals.

Consequently, there is a thematic shift from the band's earlier lyrics, which focused mostly on morbid and Satanic ideas, and the lyrics here allude to psychic powers, the Annunaki, and the creation of the human race as a workforce for alien powers. The album was released on 23 April 2007. It charted at# 12 in Norway, making it the band's highest charting album yet.

Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, forcibly expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking on the surface of water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).\n\nWhere did the director of film Free Lips die?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

In 1350, with encouragement from his mother, Edward began a devastating civil war against his brother Rainald III for control of the Duchy of Guelders. Edward led the Bronkhorster( civil) faction which in 1361 in a battle at Tiel defeated the Heekeren( aristocratic) faction, led by Edward's incapable brother who was captured and imprisoned. Edward governed well and powerfully, despite the conditions against him. He allied himself with the Bishops of L\u00fcttich and with J\u00fclich and Kleve.

In 1377, Emperor Charles IV awarded the Duchy of Guelders and the County of Zutphen to Maria's son William of J\u00fclich. After her total defeat in the Battle of H\u00f6nnepel on 24 March 1379, Mathilde renounced her claim to Guelders and Zutphen.

There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys.

Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion.

Helena was educated by private tutors chosen by her father and his close friend and adviser, Baron Stockmar. Her childhood was spent with her parents, travelling between a variety of royal residences in Britain. The intimate atmosphere of the royal court came to an end on 14 December 1861, when her father died and her mother entered a period of intense mourning. Afterwards, in the early 1860s, Helena began a flirtation with Prince Albert's German librarian, Carl Ruland. Although the nature of the relationship is largely unknown, Helena's romantic letters to Ruland survive. After the Queen found out in 1863, she dismissed Ruland, who returned to his native Germany. Three years later, on 5 July 1866, Helena married the impoverished Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple remained in Britain, in calling distance of the Queen, who liked to have her daughters nearby. Helena, along with her youngest sister, Princess Beatrice, became the Queen's unofficial secretary. However, after Queen Victoria's death on 22 January 1901, Helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings, including King Edward VII. Helena was the most active member of the royal family, carrying out an extensive programme of royal engagements. She was also an active patron of charities, and was one of the founding members of the British Red Cross.

In North America, it was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single,\" Blow Away\", while in Britain and some other markets it was the B-side of the follow- up,\" Love Comes to Everyone\". The lyrics recall Harrison's experiences under the hallucinatory effects of magic mushrooms while holidaying on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The song title refers to Hana, a remote town on the island, and is a play on that of the 1920s ragtime tune\" Hard Hearted Hannah\". Harrison began writing the song in Los Angeles in response to Ted Templeman, a staff producer at Warner Bros. Records, suggesting he compose something in a similar style to his 1971 track\" Deep Blue\". He wrote the lyrics in Hawaii in February 1978, during the main writing period for\" George Harrison\", his first album in over two years. Recorded at Harrison's FPSHOT studio in Oxfordshire, the track features dobro, jazz piano, tuba and prominent chorus vocals, as well as voices and sounds captured in his local pub. The musical arrangement recalls the music hall tradition, while the composition's old- time qualities reflect Harrison's earliest influences from the pre-rock and roll era. The other musicians on the recording include Neil Larsen and Stevie Winwood. The song's lyrics employ, variously, psychedelic imagery, rhyming slang, humorous non sequiturs and John Keats- like symbolism. The song was well received by several music critics and revealed a comedic side of Harrison that was relatively unfamiliar to listeners. Author Simon Leng recognises\" Soft- Hearted Hana\" as the start of the\" Pythonization of Harrison's music\", referring to the Monty Python comedy troupe and Harrison's role as a film producer of British comedies such as\" Monty Python's Life of Brian\".\n\nJournal of Law and Commerce\nThe Journal of Law and Commerce is a law review published by an independent student group at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, focusing on domestic and international commercial and business law.

In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at Inchon, and cut off many of the North Korean attackers. Those that escaped envelopment and capture were rapidly forced back north all the way to the border with China at the Yalu River, or into the mountainous interior. At this point, in October 1950, Chinese forces crossed the Yalu and entered the war. Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces which continued until mid-1951. After these dramatic reversals of fortune, which saw Seoul change hands four times, the last two years of conflict became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th parallel. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate. North Korea was subject to a massive bombing campaign. Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their Communist allies.\n\nWhat is the place of birth of Frederick, Prince Of Hohenzollern's mother?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He co-wrote the song\" Lover Man( Oh, Where Can You Be?)\". Davis was born in Madison, Georgia. He and his family moved to Gary, Illinois, and then to Englewood, New Jersey, where he completed his high school education. Being musically gifted, he was accepted into the Juilliard School in New York to study piano and composition, his fees being paid by a benefactress. In the late 1930s or early 1940s he wrote the song\" Lover Man( Oh, Where Can You Be?)\" with Ram Ramirez but could not initially place it, until he offered it to Billie Holiday in 1942. Because of the 1942\u2013 44 musicians' strike Holiday did n't record the song until October 1944, and although at first only a minor hit it soon achieved widespread success and went on to become a jazz standard, recorded by numerous artists including Linda Ronstadt, Barbra Streisand and Petula Clark. During the early 1940s Davis struggled to make a living as a songwriter and supplemented his meagre royalties by giving piano lessons. He was drafted in 1942, but Davis, a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People( NAACP), refused to be enlisted into a segregated regiment and demanded either exemption or service in the nonsegregated Canadian army. After a series of unsuccessful representations to the authorities, which drew press coverage and the support of several public figures, he decided not to report for duty and was imprisoned. His morale and health suffered in prison, as he revealed in letters to the writer and poet Langston Hughes( with whom he would maintain a 25- year correspondence until Hughes died in 1967), and he eventually relented and joined the army. In March 1945, Davis, then an officer attached to an army musical unit, was sent to France for six months, where he registered for a course on French language and culture open to American soldiers at the University of Paris. He wrote to Hughes that Paris\" was exactly what the doctor ordered\". Upon his return to the United States at the end of 1945 he was discharged from the army and left for Hollywood, where he joined the Actors' Laboratory Theatre, taking a course on acting. He tried to pursue a career in acting but was offered only stereotypical racial roles, and at the end of 1947 he emigrated to France. Davis was warmly welcomed in Paris, partly due to the fame of the song\" Lover Man\", and was described by the influential French critic and writer Boris Vian in\" Jazz Hot\" as\" the youngest and most sympathetic of the American composers\". He began to style himself Jimmy\" Lover Man\" Davis and entered a highly creative period, writing a number of songs and placing them with major French performers, such as Yves Montand(\" J'ai de la veine\"), Maurice Chevalier(\" Trinque, trinque[ \u00c0 la tienne]\"), and Jos\u00e9phine Baker(\" You're the Greatest Love\"). His songwriting royalties were still insufficient to live on, so he began singing his own songs in solo performances, touring through France, Italy, Holland, Spain, Switzerland and other countries. In 1957 he released an album,\" Jimmy\" Loverman\" Davis Chante Jimmy\" Loverman\" Davis\", featuring songs all co-written by himself, backed by a quartet that included his friend and fellow expatriate Aaron Bridgers on piano and the French saxophonist Michel de Villers. Apart from his musical work, Davis appeared in plays, including\" Pas de week- end pour un espion\" and\" Des souris et des hommes Of Mice and Men\"), and in the films\" La Putain respectueuse\"( 1952, uncredited),\" M\u00e9lodie en sous- sol Any Number Can Win\")( 1962, as Sam), and\" Je t' aime moi non plus\"( 1976, as Mo\u00efse).

He is \"widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets\". He wrote both verse and highly lyrical prose. Several critics have described Rilke's work as inherently \"mystical\". His writings include one novel, several collections of poetry and several volumes of correspondence in which he invokes haunting images that focus on the difficulty of communion with the ineffable in an age of disbelief, solitude and profound anxiety. These deeply existential themes tend to position him as a transitional figure between the traditional and the modernist writers. Rilke travelled extensively throughout Europe (including Russia, Spain, Germany, France and Italy) and, in his later years, settled in Switzerland \u2014 settings that were key to the genesis and inspiration for many of his poems. While Rilke is most known for his contributions to German literature, over 400 poems were originally written in French and dedicated to the canton of Valais in Switzerland. Among English-language readers, his best-known works include the poetry collections \"Duino Elegies\"  and \"Sonnets to Orpheus\" , the semi-autobiographical novel \"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge\" , and a collection of ten letters that was published after his death under the title \"Letters to a Young Poet\" . In the later 20th century, his work found new audiences through use by New Age theologians and self-help authors and frequent quotations by television programs, books and motion pictures. In the United States, Rilke remains among the more popular, best-selling poets.\n\nEddie from Ohio\nEddie from Ohio( or often just EFO) is an American folk band.

Mickey is on exhibition at a 400 m2 habitat and as of June 2009, was two years old and weighed 180 kg (400 lb). Attempts to verify this report have been bolstered by recent images purported to show the adult Mickey (see External links section). There has been no report of the birth of a healthy hybrid from a male jaguar and female tiger, which would be termed a \"jagger\".There is a claimed sighting of a lion \u00d7 black jaguar cross (male) and a tiger \u00d7 black jaguar cross (female) loose in Maui, Hawaii. There are no authenticated tiger/jaguar hybrids and the description matches that of a liger. The alleged tiger \u00d7 black jaguar was large, relatively long necked (probably due to lack of a ruff or mane) with both stripes and \"jaguar-like\" rosettes on its sides. The assertion of hybrid identity was due to the combination of black, dark brown, light brown, dark orange, dark yellow and beige markings and the tiger-like stripes radiating from its face. It is more likely to have been a released liger since these are very large and have a mix of rosettes (lion juvenile markings) and stripes and can have a brindled mix of colours exactly as described (their markings are extremely variable).\n\nHistory of Jacksonville, Florida\nIn 1513, Spanish explorers landed in Florida and claimed their discovery for Spain (see Spanish Florida). The first Europeans to visit the area were Spanish missionaries and explorers from this period. In February 1562, French naval officer Jean Ribault and a 150 settlers arrived seeking land for a safe haven for the French Huguenots, Protestants suffering religious persecution in France. Ribault explored the mouth of the St. Johns River before moving north and establishing the colony of Charlesfort on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina. Ribault returned to France for supplies, but tensions from French Wars of Religion had broken out during his absence. His return to Florida was delayed as a result. Without leadership or provisions, the colonists abandoned Charlesfort. In 1564 Ribault's former lieutenant, Ren\u00e9 Goulaine de Laudonni\u00e8re, launched a new expedition to found a colony on the St. Johns River. On June 22, 1564, the settlers established Fort Caroline atop the St. Johns Bluff.\n\nYou and the Night and the Music (Mal Waldron album)\nYou and the Night and the Music is an album by American jazz pianist Mal Waldron recorded in 1983 and released by the Japanese Paddle Wheel label.\n\nRoss Reynolds (rugby union)\nRoss John Reynolds( born 27 September 1958 in Orange) is a former Australian rugby union player, coach and businessman.\n\nSimone Bianchi (athlete)\nSimone Bianchi( born 27 January 1973) is a retired Italian long jumper.\n\nSmart Girls Don't Talk\nSmart Girls Don't Talk is a 1948 crime film directed by Richard L.

The term\" hip hop studies\" began circulating in the mid-2000s, and though it is not clear who first coined the term to label the field, the field of hip hop studies is oft cited as having been crystallized by the publication of\" That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader\" in 2003. \" That's the Joint!\" includes approximately 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism. The publication of this anthology was unprecedented, and highlights the evolving and continuous influence of\" one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s.\" The publication of the first edition of\" That's the Joint!\" marked a consolidating moment for the field of hip hop studies because it brought together key writings on hip hop from a diversity of hip hop authorities. Hip hop culture, rooted in the 1970s post -industrial South Bronx, is polyvocal and is represented in five cultural modes: rap music( oral), turntablism or\" DJing\"( aural), breaking( physical), graffiti art( visual), and knowledge( mental). Hip hop has, and continues to produce a remarkable array of thinkers who embody complex ideological makeups exemplified through their performances as writers, artists, poets, and scholars. In\" Hip Hop Matters\"( 2005), professor and media scholar S. Craig Watkins labels the increasing interdisciplinary cohort of hip hop academics and scholars as the\" hip- hop intelligentsia,\" and suggests that while this group of individuals may not often been discussed as an entity in and of itself, their existence is, without question, one of the greatest achievements of the hip hop movement. Watkins writes:\" The growing array of hip- hop intellectuals is a spectacular indication of the movement's multifaceted demeanor and ceaseless energy ... What has emerged is a body of thinkers who articulate a wide range of ideas that, in their unique way, map out the contradictory currents, ideas, and worldview that percolate throughout the phenomenal world of hip hop. From spoken- word artists to academic scholars hip- hop intellectuals are translating the movement into a vast mix of critical commentary and artistic expression. The results both energize and expand the image and imagination of the hip- hop intelligentsia.\" Hip hop studies is part of the larger hip hop movement. The research and teaching in this interdisciplinary field includes analyses of technology, pop culture, linguistics, globalization, geography, race, electoral politics, and a variety of aspects related to contemporary culture, as scholars attempt to critically assess hip hop as a movement. Scholarship in hip hop studies is rooted in the foundational, Afro-diasporic call- and- response mechanism within hip hop culture.\n\nHenry II, Margrave of Meissen\nHenry II( 1103 \u2013 1123) was the Margrave of Meissen and the Saxon Ostmark( as\" Lusizensis marchio\": margrave of Lusatia) from his birth until his death.

Following the financial success of\" Texas Chainsaw 3D\", a sequel went into development from director John Luessenhop for a planned shoot in Louisiana, but failed to receive the greenlight to move forward.

The film takes place in the canon established by\" The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" and\" Texas Chainsaw 3D\", chronologically taking place before the two films. Principal photography commenced in Bulgaria in May and June 2015, with locations and sets chosen for their resemblance to the Texas terrain and as homage to the series' previous films.

The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname \"the Harrods of the North\", although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919.

Her best-selling psychobiography of Thomas Jefferson, published in 1974, was the first serious study to examine evidence related to accounts that he had taken his slave Sally Hemings as a concubine.

He studied the mandolin at an early age and became one of the most renowned performers on this instrument. At a later date he adopted the violin also, for in 1796 he was one of the first violins in the orchestra of the Court Opera, Vienna. Born in Zlonice, near Kladno, now part of the Czech Republic, Krumpholz was the son of a bandmaster in a French regiment who lived in Paris during childhood, learning music from his father. His brother, Johann Baptist Krumpholz, was also a musician, a celebrated harpist and composer. According to music historian Philip J. Bone, there was a strong friendship between Wenzel Krumpholz and Ludwig van Beethoven. Bone talked about the relationship between Krumpholz and Beethoven in his book\" The Guitar and Mandolin\". He said that Krumpholz's name was\" immortalized by his intimacy with Beethoven, who was exceedingly fond of him, and who used to jokingly call him\" mein Narr\"( my fool).\" He talked about what men in the music business had to say about the Beethoven- Krumpholz friendship: according to Ferdinand Ries, Krumpholz gave Beethoven instruction on the violin when in Vienna and it is most probable that he gave instruction on the mandolin. Carl Czerny said in his autobiography that it was Krumpholz who had introduced him to Beethoven, and that Krumpholz was one of the first to recognize Beethoven's genius and inspired others with his own enthusiasm. Bone said that Krumpholz frequently played the mandolin to Beethoven and indicated that it influenced Beethoven to write music for the instrument. He talked about research done by Dominco Artaria, who had bought a\" Skizzenbook\", containing sketches of some of Beethoven's music. Artaria stated in his\" Aittographische Skizze\" that Beethoven intended to write a sonata for mandolin and pianoforte for Krumpholz. This composition is the one sketched in Beethoven's note book( preserved as( No. 29,801) in the manuscript department of the British Museum) and it was first made public by Breitkopf and Hartel, Leipzig. On the day following Krumpholz's death in Vienna, Beethoven composed the\" Gesang der M\u00f6nche\" from Schiller's\" William Tell\", for three men's voices\" in commemoration of the sudden and unexpected death of our Krumpholz\". Only two of Krumpholz's compositions were printed. He taught Jean- Joseph Benoit Pollet the mandolin. That same student learned harp from his brother Jean- Baptiste Krumpholz.\n\nWhich country the director of film Dika: Murder City is from?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

White\nEllen Gould White (n\u00e9e Ellen Gould Harmon; November 26, 1827 \u2013 July 16, 1915) was an author and an American Christian pioneer. Along with other Adventist leaders such as Joseph Bates and her husband James White, she was instrumental within a small group of early Adventists who formed what became known as the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The \"Smithsonian\" magazine named Ellen G. White among the \"100 Most Significant Americans of All Time. White claimed to have received over 2,000 visions and dreams from God in public and private meetings throughout her life, which were witnessed by Adventist pioneers and the general public. She verbally described and published for public consumption the content of the alleged visions. The Adventist pioneers viewed these experiences as the Biblical gift of prophecy as outlined in and which describe the testimony of Jesus as the \"spirit of prophecy.\" Her \"Conflict of the Ages\" series of writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in Biblical history and in church history. This cosmic conflict, referred to by Seventh-day Adventist theologians as the \"Great Controversy theme,\" became foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Her book on successful Christian living, \"Steps to Christ\", has been published in more than 140 languages. The book Child Guidance, a compilation of her writings about child care, training and education, has been used as the foundation for the Seventh-day Adventist school system. White was considered a controversial figure by her critics, with much of the controversy centering on her reports of visionary experiences and on the use of other sources in her writings. Historian Randall Balmer has described White as \"one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion\". Walter Martin described her as \"one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the horizon of religious history\". Arthur L. White, her grandson and biographer, writes that Ellen G. White is the most translated female non-fiction author in the history of literature, as well as the most translated American non-fiction author of either gender. Her writings covered a broad range of subjects, including religion, social relationships, prophecy, publishing, nutrition, creationism, agriculture, theology, evangelism, Christian lifestyle, education, and health. She advocated vegetarianism. She promoted and has been instrumental in the establishment of schools and medical centers all over the world, with the most renown being the Andrews University in Michigan and the Loma Linda University and Medical Center in California. During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and 40 books. more than 200 White titles are available in English, including compilations from her 100,000 pages of manuscript published by the Ellen G. White Estate are accessible at the Adventist Book Center. Her most notable books being Child Guidance, The Desire of Ages and The Great Controversy.\n\nIncandescent light bulb\nObjections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps. Some people have concerns about the health effects of fluorescent lamps. However, even though they contain mercury, the environmental performance of CFLs is much better than that of light bulbs, mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production. LED lamps are even more efficient, and are free of mercury. They are regarded as the best solution in terms of cost effectiveness and robustness.\n\nIntellectual property\nPatent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent. There is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug. In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).\n\nThe Odyssey (film)\nThe Odyssey( French title: L'odyss\u00e9e) is a 2016 French- Belgian biographical adventure film directed by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salle and written by Salle and Laurent Turner, based on the non-fiction book\" Capitaine de La Calypso\" by Albert Falco and Yves Paccalet.

Tairrie B started her music career as part of the female dance group Bardeux. After the release of their debut single, \"Three-Time Lover\", in 1987, she left the group. Under the tutelage of Eazy-E, she was later signed to his label Ruthless Records (under a new imprint called Comptown Records) and released her first album, \"Power of a Woman\", which, unlike usual Ruthless fare, was distributed by MCA Records. Tairrie B alleges she was assaulted by Dr. Dre at the 1990 Grammy Awards for not collaborating with him on her first album: \"Everyone with NWA \u2013 like Above the Law and The D.O.C. \u2013 whenever they do an album, all of the guys appear on the last track. So they were going to do that with me at one point and Ice Cube was gonna write lyrics to a track called 'I Ain't Your Bitch'. \" She refused, and rewrote the track as a diatribe against her labelmates. When Dr. Dre heard the track, he turned up at the awards ceremony party, where he punched Tairrie \"twice \u2013 once in the mouth and once in the eye. He hit me like Tyson, but I took it \u2013 I don't know how.\" It turned out to be the only Comptown Records album release. Tairrie B later began working on her second full-length album \"Single White Female\", but before releasing it decided to change her musical direction away from rap. After being released from her contract by Eazy-E, just a few weeks before his 1995 death, she then formed Manhole (later renamed Tura Satana), My Ruin and LVRS. In December 2008, Tairrie B married her long-time partner and guitarist of My Ruin Mick Murphy. She stated in the band's Myspace blog that she had changed her last name to Murphy, but would continue to use the name Tairrie B in music. In August 2015, Tairrie B returned to her rap roots with her third studio rap album \"Vintage Curses\". On October 30, 2015, cult director John Waters commented on Tairrie B\u2019s rap career and legacy in his interview with Iggy Pop on BBC Radio 6 just before playing \"Ruthless Bitch\" saying, \".. she was very much a part of the story, she was the first white girl rapper I remember.\"\n\nKongo (1932 film)\nKongo is a 1932 American pre-Code film directed by William J.
