Bradley Cooper as Rocket: A genetically engineered raccoon - like bounty hunter and mercenary who is a master of weapons and battle tactics. Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was ``not a cartoon character '', saying,`` It's not Bugs Bunny in the middle of the Avengers, it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean - ass fighting machine.'' Gunn also based the character on himself. Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, ``I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas guy. ''Cooper voiced Rocket, while Sean Gunn (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming. James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators, though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film. Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance`` the fast - talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket.''

Laodice of the Sameans
Laodice was a Queen of an unknown Kingdom in Asia. She lived at the time of the Seleucid king of Syria Antiochus X Eusebes who reigned 95 BC- 92 or 88 BC.

Laodice (wife of Mithridates III of Pontus)
Laodice (fl. late 3rd ‚Äì early 2nd centuries BCE) was a Greek Princess from the Seleucid Empire and the wife of King Mithridates III of Pontus. Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice and Laodice VI. Laodice bore Mithridates III three children: Mithridates IV of Pontus, Pharnaces I of Pontus and Laodice.

In this song, Gwenc'hlan is imprisoned after having his eyes gouged out for refusing to convert to Christianity, sings out that he is n't afraid to die and makes a prophecy wherein he will be avenged. The motive of the blinded prisoner is reminiscent of the historical fate of Boethius.

The poem was rediscovered in 1924. The Breton used by this Gwenc'hlan is already deeply pervaded by French. The legend of the 6th century bard is largely a creation of de la Villemarqu√©'s, but he may have based his account on the 15th century author, as well as on other traditional Breton tales. He quotes 6th to 12th century Welsh poems attributed to the bards Aneurin, Taliesin and Llywarch Hen as his sources.

The Goose Steps Out
Will Hay shared directorial credit with Basil Dearden following on from their previous collaboration, The Black Sheep of Whitehall. Art Director, Michael Relph described Dearden and Hay's input as directors 'Basil was very expert at directing comedy, and that is what he contributed when working with Will Hay. Hay was important as a star, and he could more or less dictate what he wanted to direct, but really he did not direct. Basil directed and supplied all the expertise that Hay probably lacked.' Barry Morse who played Kurt had a slightly different take on the directorial responsibilities. 'Basil Dearden was largely concerned with purely technical things, angles, lenses, lighting details. He didn't have a very active part, it seemed to me, in the actual performance directing. That was something which Will Hay had a certain amount to do with.'""The Goose Steps Out"" is also noted as the film debut of a young Peter Ustinov.

However, by the time that Emperor Xuan took the throne with Western Wei support in 555, Xiao Liao had already died, and so Xiao Kui, as the next son, was created crown prince.

"Mercia
When √Üthelfl√¶d died in 918, √Ülfwynn, her daughter by √Üthelred, succeeded as 'Second Lady of the Mercians', but within six months Edward had deprived her of all authority in Mercia and taken her into Wessex.

Osthryth
Osthryth (died 697), queen of the Mercians, was the wife of King √Üthelred and daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his second wife Eanfl√¶d. She probably married √Üthelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhfl√¶d had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhfl√¶d's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means ""stronghold of Fl√¶de"", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s √Üthelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by √Üthelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that √Üthelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. √Üthelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. √Üthelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against √Üthelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother √Ülfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was ""a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King √Üthelred had married his sister."" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of √Üthelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.

√Üthelred of Mercia
√Üthelred (died after 704) was King of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, √Üthelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain. He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. √Üthelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; √Üthelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria. √Üthelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 √Üthelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. √Üthelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was √Üthelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that √Üthelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.

Where was the place of burial of √Ülfgar, Earl Of Mercia's mother?";Bardney Abbey;Coventry

"Meritaten Tasherit
Meritaten Tasherit, which means"" Meritaten the Younger"" was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Meritites II (Merytiotes, Meritetes) or Meritites A (""beloved of her father"") was a 4th dynasty Princess of Ancient Egypt, and probably a daughter of King Khufu.

Robert Adam
Robert Adam (3 July 1728 ‚Äì 3 March 1792) was a Scottish neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer. He was the son of William Adam (1689‚Äì1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Cl√©risseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the ""Adam Style"", and his theory of ""movement"" in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses.

"English Renaissance
The English theatre scene, which performed both for the court and nobility in private performances, and a very wide public in the theatres, was the most crowded in Europe, with a host of other playwrights as well as the giant figures of Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Elizabeth herself was a product of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham, and wrote occasional poems such as On Monsieur's Departure at critical moments of her life. Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon. All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated, as was much of the nobility, and Italian literature had a considerable following, providing the sources for many of Shakespeare's plays. English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method, a forerunner of the Scientific Method. The language of the Book of Common Prayer, first published in 1549, and at the end of the period the Authorised Version (``King James Version ''to Americans) of the Bible (1611) had enduring impacts on the English consciousness.

"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow: An eccentric pirate characterized by his slightly drunken swagger, slurred speech and awkwardly flailing hand gestures. He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name ""Jack Sparrow""; however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, ""a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate."" At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards. Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, ""He's ruining the film!"" Depp answered back, ""Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot.""

Emperor Ling died in 189 before he managed to designate either of his two sons as crown prince. Liu Bian eventually took the throne as Emperor Shao; Empress Dowager Dong, as the emperor's grandmother, became grand empress dowager, while her daughter-in-law became empress dowager.

He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604‚Äì1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.

"Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef
Both Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef were sons of a king called Sobekemsaf, most probably Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf (Sobekemsaf II today, not I) based on an inscription from a doorjamb from a 17th Dynasty temple at Gebel Antef. While his own tomb has not been located, it was likely located in the area of Dra' Abu el-Naga' where the pyramid tomb of his brother Nubkheperre Intef was found in 2001. The pyramidion of the pyramid of Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef's pyramid was found in Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It has a slope of 60 degrees and is inscribed with this king's names. The pyramidion is now in the British Museum (BM EA 478).

Kekheretnebti
Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30‚Äì35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.

Isetnofret (daughter of Khaemwaset)
Isetnofret was an Ancient Egyptian woman and daughter of the high priest of Ptah and king's son Khaemweset( lived around 1200 BC). She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called"" daughter of his body"". On a relief found at Saqqara she is called"" his beloved daughter"" and"" king's daughter"". Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the"" noble woman"" Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.

"Beorhtweald, Ealdorman of Kent
Beorhtweald Ealdorman of Kent was an English ruler of the 9th century AD. His father was Burgred of Mercia, his mother: √Üthelswith, and his brother: Beorhtno√∞ √¶thling of Kent.

Beorhtno√∞ √¶thling of Kent
Beorhtno√∞ √¶thling of Kent was an English ruler of the 9-10th century AD. His father was Burgred of Mercia; his mother, √Üthelswith, and his brother, Beorhtweald Ealdorman of Kent.

√Üthelfl√¶d of Damerham
√Üthelfl√¶d, known as √Üthelfl√¶d of Damerham to distinguish her from other women of the same name, was the second wife of King Edmund I of England. √Üthelfl√¶d was a daughter of ealdorman √Ülfgar, probably the ealdorman of Essex. Her mother's name is not recorded. She had at least one brother and at least one sister, √Ülffl√¶d (died circa 1002). √Ülffl√¶d was married to Byrhtnoth, who probably succeeded her father as ealdorman of Essex. Byrhtnoth was killed at the Battle of Maldon in 991. √Üthelfl√¶d and √Ülffl√¶d were √Ülfgar's heirs at his death, some time between 946 and 951 based on the dating of his will, S1483. √Üthelfl√¶d married Edmund in 944 following the death of his first wife √Ülfgifu, mother of the future kings Eadwig and Edgar. She and Edmund are not known to have had any children, and Edmund was killed in 946, leaving √Üthelfl√¶d as a wealthy widow. Records of Ely Cathedral, to which she, her sister, and her brother-in-law, were generous benefactors, say that she then married an ealdorman named √Üthelstan. There were several ealdormen of that name active in the reign of Edmund's brother and successor Eadred, and it most likely that √Üthelfl√¶d married the man known as √Üthelstan Rota, although she could have married √Üthelstan Half-King. √Üthelfl√¶d's will survives, S1494, and her will, and thus her death, is dated to between 962, and more probably 975, and 991. In addition to gifts to Ely, the will endowed Glastonbury, Canterbury, Bury, and the family monastery of Stoke-by-Nayland.

Goli Soda
Baradwaj Rangan wrote ""The signature achievement of ""Goli Soda"" is its ruthless unmasking of how hollow most of our masala movies are, and how, with a little imagination, just a little, you can make a film which does not insult the audience"" and went on to state, ""I will be very surprised if there's a more entertaining, more inventive, more well-acted masala movie this year"". The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity"".

"Renegades

Which Way You Goin' Billy
There are two articles for Canadian band The Poppy Family:

Renegades (band)
Renegades were a British rock band which started out as a side-project from two members of the band Feeder, featuring guitarist Grant Nicholas and bassist Taka Hirose, before becoming a pseudonym name for Feeder themselves. Nicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother, who completed the group and a four-track EP was then recorded. Soon later, Renegades became an alternative name for Feeder at various concerts where they would play an entire show pretending not to be Feeder, but a different band with the same members. If Feeder songs released before the ""Renegades"" album were to be played, the band would announce that they're covering Feeder songs. Grant Nicholas once introduced ""Tangerine"" as ""A cover of a song from a band we know"". The idea was created when Feeder parted company with drummer Mark Richardson who returned to his previous band Skunk Anansie. Brazil was initially contracted with the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university events, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was however recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before the idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the 'Renegades' project. The tracks originally intended for the side-project were soon used for the seventh Feeder album ""Renegades"". The side-project was as a result used as a method to promote the ""Renegades"" album at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder. On the first of January 2010, a four-day countdown timer was added to the band's official website. As the countdown was completed on 6 January 2010, the title-track for the EP, ""Renegades"" was released as a free download as well as a package containing the limited edition EP, Renegades shirt, badge set and an e-ticket for one of the six shows available. The ""Renegades EP"" was the first release on the band's own record label, before being followed-up by a second EP. Feeder also used the Renegades name for their Sonisphere 2010 appearance, which was their last UK show using this name and also their tour of Japan in July of the same year. The track ""Renegades"" was re-released, but this time as a Feeder single instead of Renegades and was also on vinyl and download only.

The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book-length interview ""Hitchcock/Truffaut"" (1967), in response to filmmaker Fran√ßois Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, ""Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional.""
