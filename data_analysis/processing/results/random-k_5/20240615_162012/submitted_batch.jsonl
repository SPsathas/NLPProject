Her actual name was Jiang Caipin (\"\u6c5f\u91c7\u860b\"), originally called Consort Jiang. After being told by her that she greatly favored Plum-Blossom flowers (the flower is pronounced as \"mei\" in Chinese), Emperor Xuanzong began to fondly address her as Consort Mei. Consort Mei was initially selected by Gao Lishi, a eunuch official of Emperor Xuanzong, to become one of Emperor Xuanzong's concubines in his harem. As Consort Mei was the most literate and talented concubines, she soon obtained Xuanzong's favors. To express the favors towards Consort Mei, Xuanzong commanded servants to plant Plum-Blossom trees all around her palace to please her interest. Xuanzong even lovingly complimented her beauty as more adorable than Zhao Feiyan, and swore that he would never change his heart for her. However, in 737, after the death of Consort Wu, another favorite concubine of Xuanzong, Xuanzong was deeply depressed until Gao Lishi convinced him to try looking at Yang Yuhuan - the wife of prince Li Mao, Xuanzong son with Consort Wu since her beauty was described as the most \"irresistible\". Being curious, Xuanzong ordered Yang Yuhuan to come and subsequently fell in love with her beauty. Since Yuhuan was still literally his daughter-in-law (as she was Li Mao's wife), emperor Xuanzong then stealthily arranged Yuhuan to become a Taoist nun, after a brief moment, Xuanzong eventually offered Yuhuan honorable title as Yang Guifei (with \"Guifei\" being the highest rank for imperial consorts) after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife. Yuhuan became Xuanzong's most beloved consort as Xuanzong soon forgot about Consort Wu's death. His favors towards Consort Mei also waned.

In October 690 he ceded the imperial throne to his mother, who installed herself as empress regnant \u2013 the only woman in Chinese history ever to rule as empress regnant. Emperor Ruizong was reduced to the position of crown prince, with the unconventional title of \"Huangsi\" (\u7687\u55e3, \"imperial successor\").

Eventually, in October 698, faced with foreign invasion and dissatisfaction at home, Empress Wu accepted the suggestion of the chancellor Di Renjie and recalled the exiled Li Xian to the capital Luoyang.

Li Longji, although not the oldest son, was made crown prince on account of his accomplishments. Soon, however, tensions between Princess Taiping, who had many supporters, and Li Longji mounted. Eventually, in September 712, Emperor Ruizong, believing that astrological signs called for a change of emperors, abdicated in favor of Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong, now carrying the title of \"Taishang Huang\" (retired emperor), continued to wield actual power. However, in 713, suspecting Princess Taiping of planning a coup, Emperor Xuanzong acted first, killing her associates and forcing her to commit suicide. After the death of Princess Taiping, Emperor Ruizong himself yielded imperial powers to Emperor Xuanzong and left the governmental scene.

It is the third film in the \"Star Trek\" film series, and is the second part of a three-film story arc that begins with  (1982) and concludes with  (1986). After the death of Spock (Nimoy), the crew of the USS \"Enterprise\" returns to Earth. When James T. Kirk (William Shatner) learns that Spock's spirit, or katra, is held in the mind of Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Kirk and company steal the \"Enterprise\" to return Spock's body to his homeworld. The crew must also contend with hostile Klingons led by Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) who are bent on stealing the secrets of a powerful terraforming device. Paramount Pictures commissioned the film after the positive critical and commercial reaction to \"The Wrath of Khan\". Nimoy directed the film, becoming the first \"Star Trek\" cast member to do so. Producer Harve Bennett wrote the script starting from the end and working back, and intended the destruction of the \"Enterprise\" to be a shocking development. Bennett and Nimoy collaborated with effects house Industrial Light & Magic to develop storyboards and new ship designs; ILM also handled the film's many special effects sequences. Aside from a single day of location shooting, all of the film's scenes were shot on Paramount and ILM soundstages. Composer James Horner returned to expand his themes from the previous film. \"The Search for Spock\" opened on June 1, 1984. In its first week of release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the domestic box office, with a total of $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction to \"The Search for Spock\" was positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast and characters, while criticism tended to focus on the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. Roger Ebert called the film a compromise between the tones of the first and second \"Star Trek\" films. \" The Search for Spock\" has since been released on multiple home video formats, including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray high definition discs.\n\nKatherine de la Pole\nKatherine de la Pole (1410/11 \u2013 1473) was the oldest daughter of Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk and Katherine de Stafford.

In this capacity, between 1437 and 1440, she took care of Edmund and Jasper Tudor, the two eldest sons of Catherine of Valois (widowed queen of King Henry V of England) by her second husband Owen Tudor. Katherine persuaded King Henry VI to take an interest in the boys, who were his half-brothers. Henry later ennobled them, thereby taking one of the important steps that would later enable Edmund's son Henry Tudor to claim the English throne.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of ``childlike sensibilities ''they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things`` was the best thing ever''. To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered ``bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War ''such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia. Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series, crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror. The Duffer Brothers have cited as influence for the show (among others): Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Robert Zemeckis, George Lucas and Guillermo del Toro; films such as Alien and Stand by Me; Japanese anime such as Akira and Elfen Lied; and video games such as Silent Hill, The Last of Us, and Dark Souls.

British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792 -- 1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century. Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (``British Peace ''), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815 -- 1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the`` workshop of the world''. The British Empire expanded to include most of India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its own colonies, its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America.\n\nPlease Help Emily\nPlease Help Emily is 1917 American silent comedy- drama film starring Ann Murdock and directed by Dell Henderson.

It was recorded at the first \"John Wesley Harding\" session on October 17, 1967. It has been covered by many artists, including Joan Baez on her all-Dylan album \"Any Day Now\", as well as by Vic Chesnutt, Eric Clapton, John Doe, Thea Gilmore, Adam Selzer and Dirty Projectors. In addition, Jimi Hendrix at one point intended to cover this song, but felt it was too personal to Dylan and instead covered a different song from the album, \"All Along the Watchtower\". \"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" is a pensive ballad. Like the rest of the \"John Wesley Harding\" album, the music of \"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" uses spare, unobtrusive musical accompaniment. The primary instruments are an acoustic guitar and drums. The lyrics describe a dream that is enigmatic and subject to interpretation. However, the lyrics do convey a deeply felt sense of guilt, as well as a vision of faith, righteousness, fear and betrayal. The sense of guilt is particularly prevalent in the final verse: The opening couplet of the song paraphrases the song \"Joe Hill\", which begins with the lines \"I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night\", by Alfred Hayes and Earl Robinson. \" Joe Hill\" was a folk song written as a tribute to the union organizer Joe Hill, who was viewed by supporters as a martyr after he was convicted of a motiveless murder based on weak evidence. The reference is ironic, since the song seems to deny the existence of modern martyrs to lead humanity towards salvation. The St. Augustine in the title has often been linked to St. Augustine of Hippo, although St. Augustine of Hippo was not martyred, but died during the Vandal sack of Hippo. He was, however, a philosopher who wrote about evil and guilt, he defined the concept of original sin and therefore mankind's ultimate guilt, and could have viewed himself as being martyred in the sense of being killed by his own sins. In the dream revealed in the song, St. Augustine wears a coat of solid gold, which may signify either the worldly excesses of mankind and the Catholic Church or St. Augustine's own spiritual wealth. He also carries a blanket, which may be a sign of asceticism or of his compassion. St. Augustine searches for \"the very souls / Whom already have been sold,\" a reference to the commercialization of mankind's inner self, a motif that will recur on later songs on the album such as \"Dear Landlord\" and \"The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\". He tells \"ye gifted kings and queens\" that \"No martyr is among ye now,\" but consoles them with the knowledge that nonetheless they are not alone. But the dream ends with the narrator realizing that he himself is among those that put St. Augustine to death, initiating his feelings of guilt as he now sees the error of his ways. One interpretation of the song is that St. Augustine is a stand-in for Dylan himself, who had been viewed as a prophet or messiah, was nearly \"martyred\" in a motorcycle accident a few months before the song was written, but in any case had come too late since mankind (including himself) had already sold its soul to many temptations. Another possible interpretation is that Dylan sees himself as being among those who \"put Him out to death,\" a reference to responsibility for the death of Jesus, the ultimate expression of personal guilt. In a 2005 poll of artists published by \"MojoI Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\" was listed as the #76 greatest Bob Dylan song of all time. Dylan played the song live, in a slow waltz arrangement, at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969, a performance included on \"Isle of Wight Live\", part of the 4-CD deluxe edition of . He also played the song live on the Rolling Thunder Revue in the 1970s, as may be heard on the box set , and with the Heartbreakers in the 1980s, but has rarely performed the song live since. In 2016, Eric Clapton released his take on the tune for his studio album \" I Still Do\".\n\nBarnaby Rudge\n\"Barnaby Rudge\" was the fifth of Dickens' novels to be published.

By issue# 58( May \u2013 June 1949) it is referred to as the Fortress of Solitude, seems at a glance to be a freestanding castle, and is said to be located in a\" polar waste\".

The general public in Superman's world is either unaware or at best only vaguely aware of the existence of the Fortress, and its location is kept secret from all but Superman's closest friends and allies( such as Lois Lane and Batman). A trademark of the Fortress is that it contains a memorial statue of Jor- El and Lara, Superman's Kryptonian parents, holding a large globe of Krypton. Although Superman has living quarters at the Fortress, his main residence is still Clark Kent's apartment in Metropolis.

No foreign government officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country, although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status, which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies. In early 1865, after four years of heavy fighting which led to 620,000\u2013850,000 military deaths, all the Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederacy vanished. The war lacked a formal end; nearly all Confederate forces had been forced into surrender or deliberately disbanded by the end of 1865, by which point the dwindling manpower and resources of the Confederacy were facing overwhelming odds.

If one of the tanks is empty, the bivalent BMW engine unit switches over automatically to the other fuel system. One decisive advantage of the combustion engine is bivalence. It enables both hydrogen and petrol to be used, thus creating the ideal conditions for a transition from non-regenerative to regenerative drive energies. During electrolysis water is split into its components of hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is stored and the oxygen is needed in the vehicle for the combustion of the hydrogen. The combustion process generates energy and water as a waste product, which returns to the natural water cycle.

Some of Pei Tan's ancestors served as officials for Jin Dynasty( 265- 420), Former Qin, and Northern Wei, but Pei's several immediate ancestors did not carry any official titles.

Soon, as part of the major governmental reorganization, Pei was demoted to be the prefect of Pu Prefecture( \u84b2\u5dde, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). That was the last historical record about Pei, and it is not known when he died, although it is known that his son Pei Yuanming( \u88f4\u5143\u660e) later served as a prefectural prefect as well.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.\n\nWhen did Prince John Konstantinovich Of Russia's mother die?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Howard was the son and heir of Sir William Howard of Naworth in Cumberland, by Mary, daughter of William, Lord Eure, and great-grandson of Lord William Howard, \"Belted Will\" (1563\u20131640), the third son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. In 1645 he conformed to the Church of England and supported the government of the Commonwealth, being appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1650. He bought Carlisle Castle and became governor of the town. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Worcester on Oliver Cromwell's side and made a member of the council of state in 1653, chosen captain of the protector's body-guard and selected to carry out various public duties. In 1653 he was nominated as Member of Parliament for the Four Northern Counties in the Barebones Parliament. He was elected MP for Cumberland in 1654. In 1655 Howard was given a regiment, was appointed a commissioner to try the northern rebels, and a deputy major-general of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland. He was re-elected MP for Cumberland in 1656. In 1657 he was included in Cromwell's House of Lords and voted for the protector's assumption of the royal title the same year. In 1659 he urged Richard Cromwell to defend his government by force against the army leaders, but his advice being refused he used his influence in favour of a restoration of the monarchy, and after Richard's fall he was imprisoned. In April 1660 he sat again in parliament for Cumberland, and at the Restoration was made custos rotulorum and Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland and Lord Lieutenant of Westmorland. On 20 April 1661 Howard was created Baron Dacre of Gillesland, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Earl of Carlisle; the same year he was made Vice-Admiral of Northumberland, Cumberland and Durham, and in 1662 joint commissioner for the office of Earl Marshal. In 1663 he was appointed ambassador to Russia, Sweden and Denmark, and in 1668 he carried the Garter to Charles XI of Sweden. In 1667 Howard was made lieutenant-general of the forces and joint commander-in-chief of the four northernmost counties. In 1672 he became one of the commissioners for the office of Lord Lieutenant of Durham, and in 1673 deputy earl marshal. He commanded a regiment in the fresh-raised Blackheath Army of 1673, which was intended to see action against the Dutch. Following the Treaty of Westminster the regiment was disbanded. In 1678 he was appointed governor of Jamaica, but his instructions to introduce Poynings' Law to the island were successfully opposed by planters elected to the Jamaican Assembly. Calling the elected members \"fools, asses, beggars and cowards\", the governor arrested their leaders, William Beeston (governor) and Samuel Long, father of Jamaican planter-historian Edward Long. However, when they were deported back to England, Beeston and Long successfully argued their case, and the governor's instructions were cancelled. He was reappointed governor of Carlisle. He died in 1685, and was buried in York Minster. He married Anne (died 1696), daughter of Edward Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Escrick and great-granddaughter of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, by whom he had six children: Colonel Thomas Howard (died 1678), notorious for the 1662 duel where he left Henry Jermyn, 1st Baron Dover for dead (they were rivals for the affections of Anna Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury), was his younger brother. He was pardoned and soon afterwards married as her third husband Mary Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.\n\nTrichomoniasis\nTrichomoniasis (trich) is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. About 70% of women and men do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy.Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) which is most often spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also spread through genital touching. People who are infected may spread the disease even when symptoms are not present. Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in the vaginal fluid using a microscope, culturing the vagina or urine, or testing for the parasite's DNA. If present other STIs should be tested for.Methods of prevention include not having sex, using condoms, not douching, and being tested for STIs before having sex with a new partner. Trichomoniasis can be cured with antibiotics, either metronidazole or tinidazole. Sexual partners should also be treated. About 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatment.There were about 122 million new cases of trichomoniasis in 2015. In the United States, there are about 2 million women affected. It occurs more often in women than men. Trichomonas vaginalis was first identified in 1836 by Alfred Donn\u00e9.

She was born Agnes Dunbar Moodie on a farm near Coburg, Ontario. Her parents were John Wedderburn Dunbar Moodie and Susanna Moodie. Around five years later, the family moved to Belleville. She learned how to paint flowers from her mother. Her mother, famously, published \"Roughing it in the Bush\", a romantic history about the harshness of Canadian rural living during the 1830s. \"Roughing it\" was published in 1852, and has remained in demand and inspired writers such as Margaret Atwood to the present day. In 1868, \"Canadian Wild Flowers\" was published, viewed as one of the first serious botanical works published in Canada, which included text by Catharine Parr Traill. The book, very expensive for its time, was sold by subscription, largely through its author's own efforts; as an enterprising widow, she also worked as an illustrator to support her children and herself. Fitzgibbon was married twice: first around 1850 to Charles Thomas FitzGibbon, a barrister, who died in 1865 and then in 1870 to Brown Chamberlin, later the Queen's Printer. She had eight children with her first husband and one with her second. In 1863 she began her paintings of Canadian flora to illustrate a book by her aunt Catharine Parr Traill. After the death of her husband, she began work on a book of Canadian wild flowers, with her water-coloured illustrations and Traill's text. The book attracted 500 subscriptions, a significant number at the time. \"Canadian Wild Flowers\" first edition was published in 1868. The second and third subscribed editions were published in 1869 (Montreal: J. Lovell); and a fourth edition in 1895 (Toronto: W. Briggs). Her paintings of Canadian plants and flowers were also published in other books on Canadian flora, with 9 full page colour lithographs in Catherine Traill's \"Studies ofPlant Life in Canada\" (Ottawa: A.S. Woodburn, 1885). In 1972, 11 of the watercolour paintings were reproduced in Eustella Langdon's \"Pioneer Gardens\" (Toronto: Holt Rinehart and Winston). She died in Toronto in 1913. Agnes Chamberlin's heirs presented her paintings and copies of \"Canadian Wild Flowers\" and \"Studies of Plant Life in Canada\" to the University of Toronto in 1934\u20135. They became part of the University's Botany Department, Then, in 1966, the collection of books and paintings were transferred to the Rare Books and Special Collections of the University of Toronto Library in 1966. These books and artwork are now available in the \"Chamberlin Collection\" of the University of Toronto and digitized to view online.\n\nWho lived longer, Edward Dearle or Michael Doeberl?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film have been criticized for depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to Michael Reagan, the former president's son, ``The real story of the White House butler does n't imply racism at all. It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there. ''Paul Kengor, one of President Reagan's biographers, also attacked the film, saying,`` I've talked to many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years. They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan.'' In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa, Kengor said, ``Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it was n't replaced by a Marxist - totalitarian regime allied with Moscow and Cuba that would take the South African people down the same road as Ethiopia, Mozambique, and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went Communist. It was devastating. If the film refuses to deal with this issue with the necessary balance, it should n't deal with it at all. ''\n\nWhere did Giacomo Feo's wife die?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He was a \"consul ordinarius\" in AD 33 as the colleague of Galba, the future emperor. Felix was the son of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Faustus, and a great-grandnephew of the famed statesman Lucius Cornelius Sulla. His mother was Sextia and his older brother was Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus. Felix may be the Lucius Sulla Tacitus describes under the year 21 as coming into conflict with the future general Domitius Corbulo over who was of higher rank at a gladiatorial show. \"Corbulo had age, national usage, and the feelings of the older senators in his favor,\" writes Tacitus. \" Against him Mamercus Scaurus, Lucius Arruntius and other kinsmen of Sulla strenuously exerted themselves. \" The matter was brought to the Senate where arguments filled the room until Drusus intervened and brought the body back to order. The matter was resolved when both Sulla and Scaurus apologized to Corbulo. Ronald Syme argues for this identification, and as Scaurus is identified as Felix's uncle and step-father, concludes that Scaurus had married his mother Sextia after the death of his father, and the grandfather of Felix and the father of Scaurus had married the same woman. An inscription recorded at Pisidian Antioch describes Felix as brother-in-law to Germanicus; Ronald Syme interprets this as proof that he was briefly married to Agrippina the Younger between the death of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus in the year 41 and her marriage to Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus.\n\nWilliam Christopher of Baden-Baden\nMargrave William Christopher of Baden( born 12 October 1628 in Baden- Baden; died: 25 August 1652) was a margrave of Baden and canon at Cologne.

The archipelago consists of two main islands, West Falkland and East Falkland, and about 776 smaller islands. The islands are predominantly mountainous and hilly, with the major exception being the depressed plains of Lafonia (a peninsula forming the southern part of East Falkland). The Falklands consists of continental crust fragments resulting from the break-up of Gondwana and the opening of the South Atlantic that began 130 million years ago. The islands are located in the South Atlantic Ocean, on the Patagonian Shelf, about 300 miles (480 km) east of Patagonia in southern Argentina.The Falklands' approximate location is latitude 51\u00b040\u2032 \u2013 53\u00b000\u2032 S and longitude 57\u00b040\u2032 \u2013 62\u00b000\u2032 W. The archipelago's two main islands are separated by the Falkland Sound, and its deep coastal indentations form natural harbours. East Falkland houses Stanley (the capital and largest settlement), the UK military base at RAF Mount Pleasant, and the archipelago's highest point: Mount Usborne, at 2,313 feet (705 m). Outside of these significant settlements is the area colloquially known as \"Camp\", which is derived from the Spanish term for countryside (Campo).The climate of the islands is cold, windy and humid maritime. Variability of daily weather is typical throughout the archipelago. Rainfall is common over half of the year, averaging 610 millimetres (24 in) in Stanley, and sporadic light snowfall occurs nearly all year. The temperature has historically stayed between 21.1 and \u221211.1 \u00b0C (70.0 and 12.0 \u00b0F) in Stanley, with mean monthly temperatures varying from 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) early in the year to \u22121 \u00b0C (30 \u00b0F) in July. Strong westerly winds and cloudy skies are common.

In 1902, he co-founded the Democratic Republican Alliance, the most important centre-right party under the Third Republic, becoming Prime Minister in 1912 and serving as President of the Republic from 1913 to 1920. He single-handedly controlled French foreign policy from 1912 to the beginning of World War I, being noted for his strongly anti-German attitudes, visiting Russia in 1912 and 1914 to repair Franco-Russian relations, which had become strained over the Bosnian Crisis of 1908 and the Agadir Crisis of 1911, and giving France's support for Russian military mobilization during the July Crisis of 1914. From 1917, he exercised less influence as his political rival Georges Clemenceau had become Prime Minister. At the Paris Peace Conference, he favoured Allied occupation of the Rhineland. In 1922 Poincar\u00e9 returned to power as Prime Minister. In 1923 he ordered the Occupation of the Ruhr to enforce payment of German reparations.

The series was the result of three short experimental films that Max Fleischer independently produced in the period of 1914 \u2013 1916 to demonstrate his invention, the Rotoscope, which was a device consisting of a film projector and easel used as an aid for achieving realistic movement for animated cartoons. The Rotoscope would project motion picture film through an opening in the easel, covered by a glass pane serving as a drawing surface. The image on the projected film was traced onto paper, advancing the film one frame at a time as each drawing would be made. Fleischer's younger brother Dave Fleischer, who was working as a clown at Coney Island, served as the model for their first famous character, eventually known as\" Koko the Clown.\" \" Out of the Inkwell\" began at the Bray Studio as a monthly entry in\" The Bray Pictorgraph Screen Magazine\" produced for Paramount from 1918, and later for Goldwyn from 1920 to 1921. In that same year, The Fleischer brothers started their own studio, and in 1923, the clown who previously had no name came to be known as KO- KO when animation veteran Dick Huemer became the new Director of Animation. Huemer, who began his animation career with the\" Mutt and Jeff\" cartoons in 1916, brought the influence of the short and tall companions to\" Out of the Inkwell\" with the creation of a small canine companion named Fitz, who would later evolve into Bimbo in the sound era. Huemer redesigned the clown for animation, which reduced the Fleischer's dependency on the Rotoscope for fluid animation. He also defined the drawing style with his distinctive inking quality that the series was famous for. But it was the interaction of the live action sequences with the artist/ creator, Max Fleischer and his pen and ink creations that was the foundation of the series. Typically, the cartoons start out with live action showing Max drawing the characters on paper, or opening the inkwell to release the characters into\" reality.\" The\" Out of the Inkwell\" series ran from 1918 to mid 1927, and was renamed\" The Inkwell Imps\" for Paramount, continuing until 1929. In all, 62\" Out of the Inkwell\" and 56\" Inkwell Imps\" films were produced within 11 years. \" The Inkwell Imps\" series was replaced by the\" Talkartoons\" in 1929, and Koko was retired until 1931, appearing as a supporting character with Bimbo and Betty Boop. Koko's last theatrical appearance was in the Betty Boop cartoon,\" Ha- Ha- Ha\"( 1934), which was a remake of the silent\" Out of the Inkwell\" film,\" The Cure\"( 1924). Koko had a brief cameo in his only color theatrical appearance in the\" Screen Song\" entry,\" Toys will be Toys\"( 1949). In 1950, Stuart Productions released a number of the Inkwell Studios\" Out of the Inkwell\" cartoons, and a selection of the Paramount\" Inkwell Imps\" cartoons to television. In 1955, the\" Inkwell Imps\", along with 2,500 pre-October 1950 Paramount shorts and cartoons were sold to television packagers, the majority acquired by U.M.& M. TV Corporation. In 1958, Max Fleischer reactivated his studio in a partnership with Hal Seeger, and in 1960 produced a series of 100\" Out Of The Inkwell\" five- minute cartoons. In the new color series, KoKo had a clown girlfriend named KoKette, a pal named Kokonut and a villain named Mean Moe. Larry Storch provided the voice for KoKo and all of the supporting characters.\n\nBairavi\nBairavi is a 1978 Tamil- language Indian drama film directed by M.

These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site.

He served as editor of \"Mathematical Reviews\" from 1957 to 1964 and studied at the Institute for Advanced Study under Andr\u00e9 Weil.

The system was co-developed by WGBH and Rufus Butler Seder. On the way into the theatre, viewers pick up a reflective plastic panel mounted on a flexible stalk. The panel sits in a seat cupholder or on the floor adjacent to the seat. A large LED display is mounted on a rear wall that displays caption characters in mirror image. Viewers move the panels into position( usually below the movie screen) so they can read the reflected captions and watch the movie. It is sometimes necessary to sit in a certain area of the theater to obtain the best angle for reflecting the backward text emitted from the back of the theater on the panel while also being able to view the movie at the same time. Through this method, all screenings of a film can be accessible to caption viewers. Others seated alongside do not watch, or usually even see, the captions. Rear Window captioning is an alternative to open captioning, in which text is permanently visible. Open captioning has been little- used due to the fear that it was too intrusive and noticeable to hearing viewers. However, no studies have been conducted to elicit hearing people's opinions on how they will adapt to reading captions on screen. Rear Window captioning is a form of closed captioning because the viewer must choose to view the captions. Few movie exhibitors or theater chains choose to provide Rear Window captioning. One of the reasons often stated for not providing Rear Window captioning is the cost of the hardware( as of 2011, approximately US$ 4,500 per screen for a single installation, less for multiple installations in a multiplex). The cost of captioning a film is on the order of US$ 4,000( about$ 40 per minute). For blind viewers, audio description( Descriptive Video Service, DVS) can be and usually is transmitted along with captions. Viewers listen to the descriptions via wireless headsets. In the Rear Window system, the film print is unaffected. With the transition to Digital Cinema, closed captions are included in many digital cinema packages. In many movie advertisements by a specific cinema, the\" RWC\" acronym is often used, much like the CC acronym is used to indicate the availability of closed captions on television shows. Often,\" RWC/ DVS\" notation is used, indicating the availability of both Rear Window Captioning and Descriptive Video Service.\n\nWilli Wolff\nWilli Wolff( 1883\u20131947) was a German screenwriter, film producer and director.

He adopted the Latinized name of Noviomagus, possibly suggesting that he came from the town of Nijmegen, called\" Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum\" by the Romans. In 1561, Santbech compiled a collected edition of the works of Regiomontanus( 1436 \u2013 1476),\" De triangulis planis et sphaericis libri quinque\"( first published in 1533) and\" Compositio tabularum sinum recto\", as well as Santbech's own\" Problematum astronomicorum et geometricorum sectiones septem\". It was published in Basel by Henrich Petri and Petrus Perna. Santbech's work consisted of studies on astronomy, sundials, surveying, and levelling for water courses. It also includes descriptions of astronomical instruments, information for navigators and geographers, and general information about astronomy in the first years after Nicolaus Copernicus. Santbech also studied the subject of gunnery and ballistics as a theoretic discourse as well as for the practical application of war, and utilized the foundations of geometry, with ample references to Euclid and Ptolemy, in order to do so. Santbech seem not to have been aware of similar studies by Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia. Santbech's text included theoretical illustrations of trajectories. These were depicted with abruptly acute angles and straight lines, allowing him to create a right- angled triangle from which ranges were computed with the help of a table of sines. Santbech was of course fully aware that a cannonball's true trajectory would not consist of a straight line and a sudden drop, but these depictions were meant to assist with mathematical calculations. In 1651, Riccioli gave Santbech's name to the crater Santbech on the Moon.\n\nCricket World Cup\nThe finals of the World Cup are contested by the ten full members of the ICC (all of which are Test - playing teams) and a number of teams made up from associate and affiliate members of the ICC, selected via the World Cricket League and a later qualifying tournament.

It was released as the album's second single on March 26, 2012. Although a handful of critics assumed this was an English- language cover version of Jacques Brel's song\" Ne me quitte pas\", Spektor \u2019s song is different in every way except the title. The chord structure, melody, and lyrics are all completely different. Brel \u2019s song was written in the key of A minor, in 3/ 4 time. It is a slow, haunting story of a man trying to win back his former lover\u2014a song about the cowardice of men according to Brel. In contrast, Spektor \u2019s song is lively, in 4/ 4 time, and in a major key. Its lyrics evoke a carefree jaunt through various neighborhoods of New York City, the narrator describing all the beautiful and interesting things encountered along the way. Somehow the narrator ends up in the caf\u00e9s and gardens of Paris, and the song ends with repeated declarations of love for Paris in the rain. The song was previously released on Spektor's 2002 album\" Songs\", simply titled\" Ne Me Quitte Pas\". This version of the song featured just Spektor and her piano, while the 2012 version includes a drum machine, horns and brass instruments. The song also features lyrics sung in both English and French, evident in the title. In June 2012, Spektor released yet another version of the song online, keeping the multi-instrument production heard on\" What We Saw from the Cheap Seats\", but replacing the English verses with Russian lyrics. The new rendition was titled\" \u041d\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0439 \u041c\u0435\u043d\u044f\".

The economic transition after the German reunification in 1990 led to the closure of most large-scale factories and companies, leaving small and medium-sized ones to dominate the manufacturing sector. Well-known industrial centres are Jena (a world centre for optical instruments with companies like Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik) and Eisenach, where BMW started its car production in the 1920s and an Opel factory is based today. The most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking, vehicle production and food industries. Especially the small and mid-sized towns in central and southwestern Thuringia (e.g. Arnstadt, Schmalkalden and Ohrdruf) are highly industrialised, whereas there are fewer industrial companies in the northern and eastern parts of the Land. Traditional industries like production of glass, porcelain and toys collapsed during the economic crises between 1930 and 1990.\n\nI've Been Everywhere\n\" I've Been Everywhere\" is a song which was written by Australian country singer Geoff Mack in 1959, and made popular by Lucky Starr in 1962.

The capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the country's 4 million people.Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century. It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. The 1977 Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999.Revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of Panama's GDP, although commerce, banking, and tourism are major and growing sectors. It is regarded as a high-income country. In 2015 Panama ranked 60th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index. In 2018, Panama was ranked seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. Covering around 40 percent of its land area, Panama's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals \u2013 some of them found nowhere else on the planet.

In the summer of 36 BC Papias attacked the fleet of Lepidus transporting his invasion army from Africa to Lilybaeum( Marsala) in the southwest of Sicily. Though he managed to inflict heavy losses on the fleet of Lepidus, he ultimately failed to prevent his army from landing. Later on August 11 of the same year he led the fleet of Sextus Pompeius into the battle of Mylae against Agrippa. During course of the battle Papias' own ship was sunk, but he managed to swim to another ship of his fleet being nearby and continued the battle. However Pompeius, who observed the battle from the shore, ordered a withdrawal after he recognized that the battle seemed to tilt in Agrippa's favour and that he had reinforcements arriving as well. Papias managed an orderly retreat of the fleet into the shoals, where the larger and heavier ships of Agrippa's fleet did n't dare to follow them. Later Papias' ships slipped away and sailed eastward.\n\nTim Baillie\nTimothy Mark Baillie MBE (born 11 May 1979 in Aberdeen) is a Scottish slalom canoeist who represented Britain.

A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called middle names. In English- speaking American culture, that term is often applied( arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a\" middle name\", and is actually( to mention several types of common cases): In the United States, such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, patronymics, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the\" middle name\" is often abbreviated to the middle initial( e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for signatures) or omitted entirely in everyday use( e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings. It is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English- speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century( and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender James Francis Edward Stuart( 1688 \u2013 1766). Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase\" middle name\" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical\" Harvardiana\". The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently by the increased use of computer databases that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such databases under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like Mar\u00eda del Pilar Pereyra or Mar\u00eda de las Nieves Garc\u00eda. The abbreviation\" N.M.N.\"( no middle name) or\" N.M.I.\"( no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name. Since 1905,\" middle name\" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase\" discretion is my middle name.\"\n\nThe New Fantastic Four\nThe New Fantastic Four( on- screen title: The Fantastic Four) is an animated series produced by DePatie \u2013 Freleng Enterprises and Marvel Comics Animation( both owned by Marvel Entertainment) in 1978.\n\nGug Tappeh, Bukan\nGug Tappeh( also Romanized as G\u016bg Tappeh; also known as Gog Tappeh) is a village in Akhtachi- ye Mahali Rural District, Simmineh District, Bukan County, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran.

The film is in part a satire of the political and social rhetoric, on both sides of the issue, in the 1995 Quebec referendum; Carle was inspired by, and singled out for special opprobrium in his film, the notion offered by some of his sovereignist friends that Quebec independence would in and of itself solve the social problems of poverty, unemployment and homelessness.

Stevens was recovering during what amounted to nearly a year of convalescence, after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung and tuberculosis. He spent three months in King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, England, transferring afterward to another nine months of bedrest at home. Stevens, who was near death at the time he was admitted in the hospital, used the time he was recuperating for contemplation, and wrote dozens of songs, including\" Trouble\", many of which were recorded much later. When he was hospitalized, Stevens was often alone in a very spare and plain room. He was told that at the time he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him. The effect on the 19- year- old pop star was pronounced. He said,\" To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut.\" The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folk- rock emphasis. While recovering, Stevens donated his spare time, and some of his newer, more introspective songs for Colin Higgins and Hal Ashby's 1971 film soundtrack of\" Harold and Maude\". Most of the tunes used for the movie appear on Stevens's next albums,\" Mona Bone Jakon\" and\" Tea for the Tillerman\", with the exception of two songs which were not released until the release of the album in 1984,\" If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" and\" Do n't Be Shy\".

Social systems such as religion, language and ethnic traditions can have a powerful impact on realization of sexual orientation. Influences of culture may complicate the process of measuring sexual orientation. The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-class, well-educated samples, however there are pockets of research that document various other cultural groups, although these are frequently limited in diversity of gender and sexual orientation of the subjects. Integration of sexual orientation with sociocultural identity may be a challenge for LGBT individuals. Individuals may or may not consider their sexual orientation to define their sexual identity, as they may experience various degrees of fluidity of sexuality, or may simply identify more strongly with another aspect of their identity such as family role. American culture puts a great emphasis on individual attributes, and views the self as unchangeable and constant. In contrast, East Asian cultures put a great emphasis on a person's social role within social hierarchies, and view the self as fluid and malleable. These differing cultural perspectives have many implications on cognitions of the self, including perception of sexual orientation.\n\n2005 World Figure Skating Championships\nThe 2005 World Figure Skating Championships were held at the Luzhniki Sports Palace in Moscow, Russia from March 14 to 20.

The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy.\n\nCrazy Heart\nCrazy Heart is a 2009 American drama film, written and directed by Scott Cooper and based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Thomas Cobb.

Others argue that the ESA may encourage preemptive habitat destruction by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species; known colloquially as \"Shoot, Shovel and Shut-Up.\" One example of such perverse incentives is the case of a forest owner who, in response to ESA listing of the red-cockaded woodpecker, increased harvesting and shortened the age at which he harvests his trees to ensure that they do not become old enough to become suitable habitat. While no studies have shown that the Act's negative effects, in total, exceed the positive effects, many economists believe that finding a way to reduce such perverse incentives would lead to more effective protection of endangered species.\n\nRaymond Rajaonarivelo\nRaymond Rajaonarivelo (born 1949) is a Malagasy film director.\n\nWho is the paternal grandmother of Ingegerd Olofsdotter Of Sweden?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Henceforth, the kings of the 22nd Dynasty only controlled Lower Egypt. The Theban High Priest Osorkon B( the future Osorkon III) did date his activities at Thebes and( Upper Egypt) to Shoshenq III's reign, but this was solely for administrative reasons since Osorkon did not declare himself king after the death of his father, Takelot II.

Across the Baltic Sea lies Sweden in the west and Finland in the north.

In addition to the title, \"Bed and Sofa\" it was also released outside of the Soviet Union under the alternate titles of \"Three in a CellarOld Dovecots\", and \"Cellars of Moscow\". The film gets its Russian title from the street on which the main characters live, Third Meshchanskaia Street. Directed by Abram Room and written by Room and Viktor Shklovsky, the film starred Nikolai Batalov as the husband, Kolia, Lyudmila Semyonova as the wife, Liuda, and Vladimir Fogel as the friend, Volodia. Billed as a satire and comedy, \"Bed and Sofa\" nonetheless portrayed the realities of the Moscow working poor, while also dealing with starkly sexual situations, such as polygamy and abortion. It was originally banned in both the United States and Europe due to those stark sexual situations. The screenplay was supposedly based on the true love story of the acclaimed Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky who lived with his \"muse\" Lilya Brik and her husband Osip Brik for some years. The characters themselves also resembled the trio, with Vladimir Fogel as Mayakovsky, Lyudmila Semyonova as Lilya and Nikolai Batalov as Osip Brik. The parallels were so obvious that some critics and associates accused Viktor Shklovsky of indelicacy and gossiping. Shklovsky himself never openly admitted it, yet in his diaries he mentions that during the work on the screenplay they \u00abwere living next to Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik\u00bb, which is an obvious hint. While movies made in the USSR would soon be regulated to the ideals of Soviet realism, some films at this time were able to present starker themes. Even so, \"Bed and Sofa\" was controversial at the time of release in the Soviet Union, due to its focus on human relationships, while the state and the party are almost completely disregarded. In fact, at one point Kolya even declines to go to a Party meeting. In addition, the film's resolution is ambiguous and comes about without any input from the collective. However, it is now considered a landmark film because of humor, naturalism, and its sympathetic portrayal of the woman.\n\nWonder (Hillsong United album)\nThe band had several recording sessions for Wonder at The Record Plant in Los Angeles.

To elevate the conversation, re-awaken the soul to something other, and lift our eyes to the wonder of a superlative truth. ''`` Splinters and Stones'' was described as having ``striking vocal modification and pulsing bass samplings ''while containing personal lyrics.\n\nWho is Joan, Countess Of Chiny's paternal grandfather?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

The recording was remixed by Juan Magan for the eponymous album in 2012, a project headed by Humberto Gatica. Although the song was moderately successful during the early 1990s, it was exposed to a wider audience in the remix album \"Enamorada de Ti\".

Cenberht was said to be the son of Cedda (or Cadda), about whom nothing is recorded, and the grandson of Cutha. It is thought that Cutha is the same person as Cuthwine, also found in West Saxon genealogies. He was thus, according to later genealogies, a third cousin of King Cenwalh of Wessex. The later King Caedwalla and his brother Mul were said to be sons of Cenberht. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" for the year 661 reports that both Cuthred, son of King Cwichelm, and Cenberht died in that year. This is the sole report of Cenberht in an early source, but based on the pattern of shared rulership among the West Saxons in this period, it is presumed that Cenberht shared power with Cenwalh in a junior role, either as a junior king or as sub-king of some part of Wessex.\n\nWhich film has the director born later, Under The Lantern or Darling Of The Gods?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He was Minister of National Defense from 1944 to 1951, and the second democratically elected President of Guatemala from 1951 to 1954. He was a major figure in the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution, which represented some of the few years of representative democracy in Guatemalan history. The landmark program of agrarian reform \u00c1rbenz enacted as president was very influential across Latin America. \u00c1rbenz was born in 1913 to a wealthy family, son of a Swiss German father and a Guatemalan mother. He graduated with high honors from a military academy in 1935, and served in the army until 1944, quickly rising through the ranks. During this period, he witnessed the violent repression of agrarian laborers by the United States-backed dictator Jorge Ubico, and was personally required to escort chain-gangs of prisoners, an experience that contributed to his progressive views. In 1938 he met and married Mar\u00eda Vilanova, who was a great ideological influence on him, as was Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fortuny, a Guatemalan communist. In October 1944 several civilian groups and progressive military factions led by \u00c1rbenz and Francisco Arana rebelled against Ubico's repressive policies. In the elections that followed, Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo was elected president, and began a highly popular program of social reform. \u00c1rbenz was appointed Minister of Defense, and played a crucial role in putting down a military coup in 1949. After the death of Arana, \u00c1rbenz contested the presidential elections that were held in 1950 and without significant opposition defeated Miguel Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes, his nearest challenger, by a margin of over 50%. He took office on March 15, 1951, and continued the social reform policies of his predecessor. These reforms included an expanded right to vote, the ability of workers to organize, legitimizing political parties, and allowing public debate. The centerpiece of his policy was an agrarian reform law under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. His policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was also concerned by the presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, and \u00c1rbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. \u00c1rbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an apology for \u00c1rbenz's overthrow.\n\nMaster of International Affairs\nThe Master of International Affairs( MIA), also known as the Master of Global Affairs( MGA), is a master's degree awarded by schools of international affairs.\n\nBarbara Cartland\nDame Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland, (9 July 1901 \u2013 21 May 2000) was an English novelist who wrote romance novels, one of the best-selling authors as well as one of the most prolific and commercially successful worldwide of the 20th century.

It was written, directed, produced and financed by Samuel Fuller, himself a New York reporter prior to turning to filmmaking. It was his favorite film, though it did not do well at the box office. The title refers to the street in Manhattan where most of New York City's newspapers were located.\n\nJacques-Antoine-Marie Lemoine\nJacques-Antoine-Marie Lemoine, also Lemoyne (17 July 1751 \u2013 7 February 1824), was a French artist, known primarily for portraiture. Lemoine was born in Rouen. He declined to follow his father's precedent in becoming a notary, and instead began study at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Rouen. Having moved to Paris by 1772, he studied under Jean-Jacques Lagren\u00e9e (1737\u20131821) and Maurice-Quentin de la Tour (1704\u20131788). He was attracted to Parisian theater and music, and early in his career often portrayed actors, singers, and musicians, using pastels and chalk. He also worked in oil, watercolor, and porcelain. In the late 1770s or early 1780s, he may have sketched for fashion plates. In 1783, Lemoine married the artist Agathe-Fran\u00e7oise Bonvallet. He began his work as a miniaturist in the mid-1780s. His early miniatures are influenced by the \"free and painterly technique\" of Pierre-Adolphe Hall. In 1785, he painted Louise Beno\u00eet Zamor, the page of Madame du Barry and later revolutionary. The portrait is one piece of evidence for Zamor's African origin. Lemoine invented a perspective easel for use in landscape painting, and another device to help create likenesses in portraiture. He also collected texts on geometry and perspective in relation to design and painting. Lemoine's wife died in 1794, and he returned to Rouen, where he was appointed professor of drawing at the \u00c9cole de Marine in 1799. After 1798, he produced few works, but kept a pied-\u00e0-terre in Paris and continued to exhibit at the Salons through 1817. He died at his home in Paris, and bequeathed his manuscript collection to the state. Germaine Greer points out that because Marie-Victoire Lemoine sometimes signed her works \"Lemoine,\" the works of the two artists may sometimes be misattributed.\n\nRio do Peixe (Mojigua\u00e7u River)\nThe Rio do Peixe is a river of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais states in southeastern Brazil.

According to Jonathan Riley-Smith, however, he may have indeed been connected to Chartres, as the brother of Hugh of Le Puiset, Count of Jaffa; he would then have also been a cousin to the Montlh\u00e9ry family of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. However, nothing certain is known of his life before 1115, when he appears as constable of Jaffa under Hugh. In 1120 he was present at the Council of Nablus, where the first laws of the kingdom were promulgated, perhaps representing the new, underaged Count of Jaffa, Hugh II. Around the same year, his services were rewarded with a marriage to Helvis of Ramla, daughter of Baldwin I of Ramla. In 1134, when Hugh II rebelled against King Fulk, Barisan supported the king, and soon became prominent at Fulk's court. In 1141, perhaps as a reward for his loyalty in 1134, he was granted the newly constructed castle of Ibelin, located in the County of Jaffa between Jaffa itself and the Fatimid Egyptian fortress of Ascalon. It was from this castle that the family took their name. In 1148 Barisan inherited the nearby lordship of Ramla, through his wife Helvis. That year, Barisan was also present at the council convened at Acre after the arrival of the Second Crusade, at which it was decided to attack Damascus. Barisan died in 1150 and Ibelin was inherited by Hugh. Helvis then married Manasses of Hierges, Constable of Jerusalem.

Since 10 April 2019 he has been in pretrial detention, due to an ongoing investigation on corruption, money laundering, and connections to Odebrecht, a public works company accused of paying bribes. Kuczynski was born in the Miraflores District of Lima to a German Jewish father and a Swiss mother of French descent. Kuczynski's parents fled from Germany after the Nazis came to power. Kuczynski worked in the United States before entering Peruvian politics. He held positions at both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund before being designated as the general manager of Peru's Central Reserve Bank.

Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership, he eventually consolidated power to become the country's \"de facto\" dictator by the 1930s. A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism\u2013Leninism, while his own policies are known as Stalinism. Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, \"Pravda\", and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's 1924 death. Under Stalin, \"Socialism in One Country\" became a central tenet of the party's dogma. Through the Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the famine of 1932\u201333. To eradicate accused \"enemies of the working class\", Stalin instituted the \"Great Purge\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state. Stalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, it signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German incursion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The Soviets annexed the Baltic states and helped establish Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global superpowers. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc which became known as the Cold War. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it developed a nuclear weapon in 1949. In these years, the country experienced another major famine and an anti-semitic campaign peaking in the doctors' plot. After Stalin's death in 1953 he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who denounced his predecessor and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society. Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his totalitarian government has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, ethnic cleansing, deportations, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines which killed millions.\n\nWhich film was released more recently, Aami or Bitch Slap?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He was an important Proven\u00e7al nobleman. William was the son of Bertrand of Baux, the first Prince of Orange a major patron of Occitan poetry, and Tibors de Sarenom, a sister of Raimbaut d' Aurenga and herself a trobairitz. In 1215 when the Emperor Frederick II sought to make his power effective in the Kingdom of Burgundy, he granted to William at Metz the whole\" Kingdom of Arles and Vienne\", probably referring to the viceroyalty of the kingdom. William was imprisoned in Avignon in the summer of 1216 and remained there until his death in June 1218. William's descendants continued to claim the Kingdom of Arles until 1393. William was a man of letters and a troubadour, inheriting his love of lyric poetry from his patron- composer parents. Two\" coblas\" and a\" sirventes\" are preserved of William's writings. He was also in contact with other troubadours. The lone surviving\" sirventes\" of Gui de Cavalhon was written against William. An anecdotal\" razo\" is preserved describing how William robbed a French merchant, who subsequently took his case to the king, Philip Augustus, but was rejected because\" it had taken place too far away\"( i.e. out of French jurisdiction in Provence). The merchant subsequently counterfeited the royal seal and used it to lure William to his( unnamed) city with promises of rewards. When William and his companions arrived in the city the merchant had them arrested and imprisoned until he had made amends for what he had taken. On his return to Provence, William allegedly planned to annex a piece of land(\" la Osteilla\" or\" Estella\") belonging to Ademar II of Valentinois when he was captured by Ademar's fisherman in a small boat on the Rh\u00f4ne. This event inspired a\" cobla\" from the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, who nicknamed William\" Engles\"( the Englishman, for unknown reasons). William married Ermengarde, daughter of Raymond of M\u00e9vouillon, but divorced her on 21 March 1203. Their child, Raymond I of Baux, succeeded his father as Prince of Orange and King of Arles. William remarried to a woman named Alix. His sons by her, William II and Bertrand II, both later inherited Orange.

He was born in Lowick, Northamptonshire, the second son of John Mordaunt, 1st Earl of Peterborough and Elizabeth Howard (d. 1671), daughter of William Howard, 3rd Baron Howard of Effingham. In June 1648, he joined his brother, Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough in leading a Royalist uprising, and fled with him to the Continent when it failed. He had returned to England by 1652, and married Elizabeth Carey on 7 May 1657. He again engaged in Royalist conspiracy, and met the Marquess of Ormonde on his secret trip to England in 1658. Mordaunt was betrayed and arrested on 1 April 1658. Released and re-arrested on 15 April 1658, he was charged with treason. Thomas Pride, one of the commissioners to try him, fell ill, and a key witness escaped (possibly due to the efforts of his wife), and Mordaunt was acquitted by a vote of 20 to 19 by the commissioners. This narrow escape did not deter his secret efforts on behalf of Charles II. However, although trusted by the King, Ormonde, and Hyde, many royalists (including the members of the Sealed Knot) disliked and mistrusted him. He was created Viscount Mordaunt of Avalon and Baron Mordaunt of Reigate on 10 July 1659 by Charles, who considered him the leader of his cause in England. However, the new rising he planned in June was several times delayed, partly because of friction with other royalists, and the Council of State ordered his arrest. The rising, in Surrey, drew only thirty followers, and Mordaunt narrowly escaped to France in September. He returned to England again in October after the expulsion of the Rump Parliament, and was planning another rising, but his connections with Hyde occasioned suspicion and he received little favour from any party. He returned to France again in November, then to England again in January. His attempts to discredit Monck and promote French intervention were fruitless: he and Monck were both knighted by Charles at Dover on 25 May 1660. He was appointed Constable of Windsor Castle, keeper of Windsor Great Park and Lord Lieutenant of Surrey upon the Restoration, but played little role at court. In 1666, he was charged in the House of Commons with having imprisoned William Taylor, surveyor of Windsor Castle, and raped Taylor's daughter. He was impeached by the Commons in December, but Parliament was prorogued in February, and the King pardoned him in July. He resigned his offices at Windsor in September 1668, and went abroad to Montpellier that year. He did not return to England until 1669, and thenceforth lived in retirement in his house at Parson's Green, Middlesex. He died there of a fever in 1675, and is buried at All Saints Church, Fulham, London.\n\nFrancisca Queiroz\nFrancisca Vaz Queiroz( born September 4, 1979) is a Brazilian television and film actress.

As the opening track, the song serves as an introduction to the musical and lyrical themes of the album. West establishes the academic narrative of it, celebrating his graduation in the realm of hip hop and rapping about his skepticism of higher education over thumping, off-kilter boom bap drums. The composition of \"Good Morning\" is both light and dark in tone and retains keyboard-laden, electronic instrumentation in addition to being imbued with poignant introspection. The song's atmospheric hip hop production harbors a subdued measure of progressiveness as West incorporates New-Age and ambient elements. His pensive verses are largely built on self-aggrandizing undercut with self-criticism and explore lyrical concerns pertaining to anti-establishment. The song's lyrics express motivational declarations of triumph and contain numerous pop-culture references. \"Good Morning\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics, who praised its production as well as West's wordplay. West performed the song as the opener of the set-list on his worldwide Glow in the Dark Tour (2008).

Sigismund was his baptismal name; Sigismund's pagan Lithuanian birth name is unknown. He was the son of the Grand Duke of Lithuania K\u0119stutis and his wife Birut\u0117. After the death of K\u0119stutis, he was a prisoner of Jogaila from 1382\u20131384. Sigismund was baptized in Catholic rite in 1383. In 1384, he escaped captivity and joined his brother Vytautas the Great, who allied himself with the Teutonic Knights. When Vytautas allied with the Teutonic Knights for the second time to fight Skirgaila, Sigismund was a hostage of the Teutonic Knights, together with his family, from 1389\u20131398. He became Duke of Navahradak (1390\u20131440), and Starodub from 1406. He participated in the Battles of Vorskla and the Grunwald. After the death of Vytautas, he supported his cousin \u0160vitrigaila in his fight against Poland, but later was convinced by nobles to join a conspiracy against him. On 1 September 1432, Sigismund became the Grand Duke of Lithuania. He signed the Union of Grodno with Jogaila and ceded some territories in Volhynia and Podolia to Poland. However, \u0160vitrigaila was still active and had the support of many Eastern Orthodox nobles. In 1434, in an attempt to attract support from these nobles, he issued a privilege to nobles of Eastern Orthodox faith, making their rights equal to those of noble Roman Catholics. He guaranteed that no noble, regardless of religion, could be imprisoned or punished without a court order. The privilege was an important development and accelerated formation of a feudal system. Sigismund's army defeated \u0160vitrigaila in the Battle of Pabaiskas on 1 September 1435. The Livonian Order, an ally of \u0160vitrigaila, suffered a major defeat. After strengthening his positions in Lithuania, he tried to loosen his ties with Poland and negotiated between 1438 and 1440 with Albert of Hungary (who was also the German king) for an anti-Polish alliance, but was killed by supporters of \u0160vitrigaila (possibly led by Alexander Czartoryski) at the Trakai Peninsula Castle on 20 March 1440. Sigismund had one son, Michael Boleslaw, who died shortly before 10 February 1452.\n\nEdward Shepherd (footballer)\nEdward Arthur Shepherd( 18 May 1903 \u2013 November 1984) was an English professional football full back who appeared in the Football League for Brentford.\n\nWaiting for the Hearse\nWaiting for the Hearse( Esperando la carroza in Spanish) is a 1985 Argentine comedy film directed by Alejandro Doria.

Unifying what is now modern Vietnam in 1802, he founded the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, the last of the Vietnamese dynasties. A nephew of the last Nguy\u1ec5n lord who ruled over southern Vietnam, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh was forced into hiding in 1777 as a fifteen-year-old when his family was slain in the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n revolt. After several changes of fortune in which his loyalists regained and again lost Saigon, he befriended the French Catholic priest Pigneau de Behaine.

Following their defeat, he succeeded in reuniting Vietnam after centuries of internecine feudal warfare, with a greater land mass than ever before, stretching from China down to the Gulf of Siam. Gia Long's rule was noted for its Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Hu\u1ebf as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and turning it into a vassal state.\n\nWho was born earlier, Ela Gandhi or Sebasti\u00e1n Borensztein?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He was the eighth son of Emperor Gaozong and the fourth son of Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (During the first period, he did not rule the, and the entire government In the hands of to his mother, Empress Wu, later as Wu Zetian Is known Was). In February 684, Li Dan's mother Empress Wu demoted his older brother Emperor Zhongzong (Li Xian) who had attempted to rule free of his mother, and named him emperor (as Emperor Ruizong). Emperor Ruizong, however, was a puppet under control of his mother and did not have any real power. In October 690 he ceded the imperial throne to his mother, who installed herself as empress regnant \u2013 the only woman in Chinese history ever to rule as empress regnant. Emperor Ruizong was reduced to the position of crown prince, with the unconventional title of \"Huangsi\" (\u7687\u55e3, \"imperial successor\"). In the following years, Empress Wu's nephews Wu Chengsi and Wu Sansi tried to have one of them named heir to the throne, but Wu Zetian resisted these calls. Eventually, in October 698, faced with foreign invasion and dissatisfaction at home, Empress Wu accepted the suggestion of the chancellor Di Renjie and recalled the exiled Li Xian to the capital Luoyang. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the position of crown prince to his elder brother, and Li Xian became crown prince instead. In 705, a coup overthrew Wu Zetian and restored Emperor Zhongzong to the throne. The five years of Emperor Zhongzong's reign were dominated by Zhongzong's empress consort, Empress Wei. In the beginning of July 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei who then named Zhongzong's youngest son Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen emperor (as Emperor Shang). A mere two weeks later, Li Dan's sister Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi launched a coup which resulted in the death of Empress Wei. Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song then persuaded Li Dan to take the throne himself, and he agreed, returning to the throne in Emperor Shang's stead. Li Longji, although not the oldest son, was made crown prince on account of his accomplishments. Soon, however, tensions between Princess Taiping, who had many supporters, and Li Longji mounted. Eventually, in September 712, Emperor Ruizong, believing that astrological signs called for a change of emperors, abdicated in favor of Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong, now carrying the title of \"Taishang Huang\" (retired emperor), continued to wield actual power. However, in 713, suspecting Princess Taiping of planning a coup, Emperor Xuanzong acted first, killing her associates and forcing her to commit suicide. After the death of Princess Taiping, Emperor Ruizong himself yielded imperial powers to Emperor Xuanzong and left the governmental scene. He died in 716.\n\nInnocent of Alaska\nSaint Innocent of Alaska (August 26, 1797 \u2013 March 31, 1879, O.S.), also known as Saint Innocent Metropolitan of Moscow (Russian \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0418\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439) was a Russian Orthodox missionary priest, then the first Orthodox bishop and archbishop in the Americas, and finally the Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia.

This familiar explanation \"fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso's new painting developed.\" Between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both Les Nabis and the Symbolists (who also admired C\u00e9zanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. Neo-Impressionist structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of Georges Seurat (e.g., Parade de Cirque, Le Chahut and Le Cirque), was another important influence. There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.\n\nDo both films, The Wild Frontier (Film) and The Sundowners (1960 Film), have the directors who are from the same country?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He held the titles of \"comes\" (count) and \"dux\" (duke) and he ruled over a \"marca\" (march). He may have been the son of Hadulf, son of Thankulf. Thachulf was placed in charge of the Sorbian March in 849 with the title of \"dux Sorabici limitis\", giving him military command over the counts with lands bordering the Sorbs. On account of his knowledge of Slavic customs, he was petitioned by the Sorbs with the offer of hostages for peace to protect them from the warmaking of Ernest, Duke of Bavaria, but he had been wounded in battle the day before the arrival of the Slav embassy and so could not be of assistance. Hiding his injury from the Slav delegates, he sent men to the other leaders of the Frankish host proposing terms with the Slavs, but the other generals suspected him of a \"coup\" to assume supreme command of the army and so ignored his representatives and made war anyway, being badly defeated in the process. According to the \"Annales Fuldenses\", in 858, a Reichstag held at Frankfurt under Louis the German sent three armies to the eastern frontiers to reinforce the submission of the Slavic tribes. Carloman was sent against Great Moravia, Louis the Younger against the Obodrites and Linonen, and Thachulf against the Sorbs, who were refusing to obey him. The armies of Carloman and Louis set out in July, but it is uncertain if Thachulf ever undertook a campaign, as the Sorbs rose in rebellion late in that year and do not appear to have been restless beforehand.

He was created a Baron by Alexander II of Russia. He studied in Bremen, and learned the cotton business at Manchester with the Bremen-born cotton exporter Johan Frerichs's company De Jersey & Co. He went to Moscow as assistant to the firm's agent Franz Holzhauer in 1840. That year he established the first power-driven cotton mill in Russia. In 1842, the British ban on the export of cotton machinery, imposed in 1775 to protect the country's head start in technology, was lifted, allowing the manufacture of cotton to expand in Russia. Knoop used English credit to build and fit out mills with English equipment. The commissioning in 1847 of Morozov's Nikolsk mill at Orekhovo-Zuyevo, Knoop's sixth, was seen as a landmark in the industry's development in Russia. In 1852, he founded L Knoop & Co, in association with De Jersey and the machinery manufacturer Platt Brothers of Oldham, Lancashire. In 1857, he built the largest cotton spinning mill in Europe on the island of Kreenholm at Narva, Estonia, which employed 4500 people. The Krenholm Manufacturing Company's factory in Narva had nearly half a million spindles driven by water-power. It paid low wages, but took its responsibilities to its workforce seriously, introducing a health insurance scheme and supplying workers with dwellings, kindergartens, and schools. Eventually, he was responsible for equipping 187 cotton mills on Russian territory. However, Knoop came under attack from the Russian Technical Society for retarding industrial development in the country. This was because he relied exclusively on English machinery and also supplied the factories with English managers, technicians, and supervisors. He was created a baron by Tsar Alexander II in 1877. He died on 16 August 1894 at St Magnus, Bremen, where a city park created from his estate is named after him. His descendants include Ernst Albrecht, Hans-Holger Albrecht and Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nSydney Newman\nSydney Cecil Newman, OC( April 1, 1917 \u2013 October 30, 1997) was a Canadian film and television producer, who played a pioneering role in British television drama from the late 1950s to the late 1960s.

He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people. Originating in Phoenix, Arizona in 1964, \"Alice Cooper\" was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and Neal Smith on drums. The original Alice Cooper band released their debut album in 1969, and broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit song \"I'm Eighteen\". The band reached their commercial peak in 1973 with their sixth studio album \"Billion Dollar Babies\". The band broke up in 1975 and Furnier adopted the band's name as his own name, beginning his solo career with the 1975 concept album \"Welcome to My Nightmare\". Expanding from his detroit rock roots, Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, including art rock, hard rock, heavy metal, new wave, glam metal, and industrial rock. He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal, and has been described as the artist who \"first introduced horror imagery to rock and roll, and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre\". He is also known for his witty and humorous personality offstage, with \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" calling him the world's most \"beloved heavy metal entertainer\". Away from music, Cooper is a film actor, a golfing celebrity, a restaurateur, and, since 2004, a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show \"Nights with Alice Cooper\".\n\nWhich album was released first, The Oak Ridge Boys Have Arrived or Beans And Fatback?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

At club level he played for Clyde, Hamilton, Hibernian, Dundee and Kilmarnock, helping Clyde win the Scottish Cup in 1939. He also played once for the Scotland national football team, in a 1939 British Home Championship match against Wales. Brown's football career was clearly interrupted by the Second World War, as his two greatest achievements, winning a Scotland cap and the Scottish Cup, came during the last season completed before the war. Brown only conceded one goal in the whole competition en route to winning the Scottish Cup, a penalty kick in a 4\u20131 win against Rangers. He later complained that he would not have conceded even that solitary goal if Rangers had used their regular penalty taker, Bob McPhail, because Brown knew where McPhail normally placed his penalties. A transfer to Arsenal was proposed, but did not materialise due to the outbreak of war in September 1939. During the war he entered the service of the Royal Navy, while making guest appearances for Hamilton. He transferred to Hibernian in 1942, but played for Gillingham of England's Kent League between 1944 and 1946. Upon returning to Hibernian, he helped them win the Scottish league championship in 1947\u201348. Brown then had spells with Dundee and Kilmarnock before retiring as a player in 1950. He then became a physiotherapist, working for Kilmarnock, the All Blacks and the Scotland national rugby union team. Brown was the first person to serve in that function for the Scotland rugby side. Brown was part of a sizeable sporting family. His sons Peter and Gordon (\"Broon frae Troon\") both played for Scotland at rugby union, while two of his brothers, Tom and Jim, also played professional football.

Newcomen apprently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide - ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged to come to an arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent. Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on Papin's experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into the lower half of the cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity - induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity - actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power stroke raised the pump, priming it and preparing the pumping stroke. At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical plug tree suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self - acting.\n\nMike McRae\nMichael Keith\" Mike\" McRae( born July 9, 1955 in Pembroke, North Carolina) is a retired long jumper from the United States, who represented his native country at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

Designated the \"Godfather of Punk\", he was the vocalist of influential proto-punk band the Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited multiple times since. Initially playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll, the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by Pop. He had a long collaborative and personal friendship with David Bowie over the course of his career, beginning with the Stooges' album \"Raw Power\" in 1973. With both musicians having relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions, Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums \"The Idiot\" and \"Lust for Life\". Throughout his career, Pop is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics and distinctive voice. He was one of the first performers to do a stage-dive and popularized the activity. Pop, who traditionally (but not exclusively) performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd. Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including garage rock, punk rock, hard rock, art rock, new wave, jazz, blues, and electronic. Though his popularity has fluctuated through the years, many of Pop's songs have become well known, including \"Search and Destroy\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" by the Stooges, and his solo hits \"Lust for LifeThe Passenger\" and \"Real Wild Child (Wild One)\". In 1990, he recorded his first and only Top 40 U.S. hit, \"Candy\", a duet with B-52's singer Kate Pierson. Although Pop has had limited commercial success, he has remained both a culture icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres. The Stooges' album \"Raw Power\" has proved an influence on artists such as Sex Pistols, the Smiths, the Sisters of Mercy, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Nirvana. His solo album \"The Idiot\" has been cited as a major influence on a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial artists including Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and Joy Division, and was described by Siouxsie Sioux as a \"re-affirmation that our suspicions were true: the man is a genius. \" He was inducted as part of the Stooges into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nLee Burge\nLee Stephen Burge( born 9 January 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for League One club Sunderland.\n\nFranciszek Ferdynant Lubomirski\nPrince Franciszek Ferdynant Lubomirski (c. 17101774) was a Polish noble (szlachcic) and Knight of the Order of the White Eagle, awarded on 3 August 1762 in Warsaw.

Her husband married about fifteen women during his lifetime, but she was one of his earliest wives. She held prestige within the harem for several reasons: because of her seniority among the Shah's wives; because she was a member of the family by birth and therefore well- networked and well- versed in their ways; because she bore her husband as many as five children( two of whom reached adulthood) and most of all because she was the mother of the crown prince.

He was a son of William de Vesci and Lady Agnes de Ferrers, daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, and Sibyl Marshal. He founded the Grey Abbey in Kildare, Ireland for the Franciscans in 1260. During the Second Barons' War campaign of 1265, William held Gloucester Castle against Prince Edward. He was pardoned afterwards and entered the service of King Henry III of England. He served against the Welsh in 1277 and later in 1282. He was appointed the justice of the forests north of the Trent in 1285. Upon the death of his brother John de Vesci in 1289, William succeeded to the family estates, including as Lord of Sprouston in Scotland. He was also granted the Constable of Scarborough Castle between 1289 until 1292. William was sent with Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham in 1289 to represent King Edward I of England in Scotland. He also founded White Abbey, near Kildare, Ireland for the Carmelites in 1290. Upon the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, William became one of the competitors for the Crown of Scotland, deriving his claim from his grandmother, Margaret, illegitimate daughter of William the Lion and the wife of Eustace fitz John. William's claim was withdrawn on the eve of the King Edward I of England announcing which of the claimants would inherit the throne in 1292. With the death of his mother, Agnes on 11 May 1290, he inherited large estates in Ireland, including the franchise of the County Kildare with Kildare Castle and Rathangan Castle. On 12 September 1290, William was appointed Lord Justice in Ireland by King Edward I of England. His service was interrupted by complaints with William entering the king's court in 1293 and 1294 to answer charges against him. Sir John FitzThomas, 4th Lord Offaly, fiercely quarrelled with William over rival claimants of the King of Connaught. FitzThomas made claims to King Edward I of England that William had accused the king of cowardice during the siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, and was organising a rebellion against the king. William lost his position as Lord Justice. William attempted to sue FitzThomas for defamation before the council at Dublin. King Edward I summoned all the parties to Westminster, however, FitzThomas did not appear, and although William requested for a judgment in his favour by reason of the default, this was not allowed, with the matter finally being resolved during the parliament in August 1295. He was summoned to Parliament as a baron in 1295. While he regained the king's favour, William did not regain his position of Lord Justice in Ireland, however was restored to his former position as justiciar of the forests beyond Trent. He was sent to Gascony in December 1295 on the king's service. William surrendered his lands of Kildare in 1297 on condition of his and his brother's debts to the exchequer being forgiven. Edward I regranted his lands in Kildare for life only. William also resigned Malton Castle and his Yorkshire estates to Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, however he received them back for life and entailed after his death on his illegitimate son and his heirs.

The Germans demanded that Lithuania give up the Klaip\u0117da Region (also known as the Memel Territory) which had been detached from Germany after World War I, or the Wehrmacht would invade Lithuania. The Lithuanians had been expecting the demand after years of rising tension between Lithuania and Germany, increasing pro-Nazi propaganda in the region, and continued German expansion. It was issued just five days after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. The 1924 Klaip\u0117da Convention had guaranteed the protection of the status quo in the region, but the four signatories to that convention did not offer any material assistance. The United Kingdom and France followed a policy of appeasement, while Italy and Japan openly supported Germany, and Lithuania was forced to accept the ultimatum on 22 March. It proved to be the last territorial acquisition for Germany before World War II, producing a major downturn in Lithuania's economy and escalating pre-war tensions for Europe as a whole.\n\nWhere was the director of film Blood Father born?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

The song actually appears in two different versions on the album at the beginning of side 2 under the title\" America Drinks\" and finishing at the end of side 2 under the title\" America Drinks& Goes Home\". In between these songs is a sequence containing\" Status Back BabyUncle Bernie's FarmSon of Suzy Creamcheese\" and\" Brown Shoes Do n't Make It\". Zappa's title for the entire piece was\" Suite No. 2: The M.O.I. American Pageant( 2nd in a Series of Underground Oratorios)\". The piece was performed many times during the Mothers of Invention residency at the Garrick Theater in Greenwich Village in New York City during 1967. Zappa wrote the song to parody his experiences playing with drunken lounge music bands in the early 1960s. The song combines a trite love song lyric with an equally cliched melody. In a radio interview Zappa also described the ii \u2013 V\u2013 I progression chord changes in this song as a\" satire\" of Jazz chord changes in that they go in unexpected or wrong directions. The members of The Mothers perform the song in a very sloppy way on purpose. Sound effects were creatively added to the recording to give it an authentic nightclub feel. At the end of the recording the audience sounds devolve into screams as lead vocalist Ray Collins says good night to the audience and tells them to\" drink it up, folks.\" Soon after the song was released in early 1967 a few other songs appeared which used very similar ideas such as\" On with the Show\" by The Rolling Stones( released in 1967),\" My Friend\" by Jimi Hendrix( recorded in 1968, released in 1971) and\" You Know My Name( Look Up the Number)\" by The Beatles( recorded in 1967 and 1969, released in 1970.)\n\nWhat is the place of birth of the director of film Martial Law (1991 Film)?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Schure founded the New York Institute of Technology( NYIT) in 1955. He also served as the Chancellor of Nova Southeastern University( NSU) from 1970 until 1985. Schure is credited with saving Nova University, which was in deep financial trouble, after he became the school's chancellor in 1970. The university is now called Nova Southeastern University, and is now the largest private university in Florida, with more than 28,000 students as of 2009. Schure and then- Nova University President Abraham Fischler, Ed.D., formed a federation between Nova and the New York Institute of Technology. The partnership between the two institutions brought money and new programs to Nova University. The money from NYIT allowed Nova University to remain open during its financial difficulties. The alliance between NYIT and Nova University ended in 1985. In November 1974 Schure hired recent University of Utah doctoral graduate Edwin Catmull to direct NYIT's fledgling computer graphics lab, and ensured that the lab received special funding for more than 5 years. Schure was an early champion of computer animation; in 1979 Catmull left to form a computer- graphics group with Lucasfilm and the core technical team- including computer animation pioneers Alvy Ray Smith, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim, Jim Blinn, and Jim Clark- came from the NYIT lab. ( In 1986, that computer- graphics group would be funded by recently fired Steve Jobs as the independent company Pixar which manufactured and sold image- processing computers using the concepts first developed at NYIT, and also produced projects using them.) Although Clark would move on to found Silicon Graphics and Netscape, the rest of the NYIT team continued to play key roles as Pixar's animation developed from its first short films in the mid-1980s onward. It can be said that Dr. Schure's vision and support from 1975 to 1980, and the low- pressure academic research lab environment at NYIT, was an essential contributor to the development of many of the technical innovations needed to produce realistic computer generated films. He funded the computers and frame buffers used in the making of the unfinished computer- generated film\" The Works( film)\". It was also during this time that Schure directed the animated movie Tubby the Tuba( 1975 film). Alexander Schure died from complications of Alzheimer's Disease on Long Island on October 29, 2009, at the age of 89. He was survived by his second wife, Gail; and four children- Dr. Barbara Schure Weinschel, Dr. Matthew Schure, Dr. Jonathan Schure, and Mr. Louis Schure.

It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, near Moscow in Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 November 2016. The name is in line with the tradition of honoring a scientist, in this case the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who has played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. It is one of only two elements named after a person who was alive at the time of naming, the other being seaborgium; it is also the only element whose namesake is alive today.Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the nuclide 294Og have been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For example, although oganesson is a member of group 18 \u2013 the first synthetic element to be so \u2013 it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the noble gases). It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the last one of period 7.\n\nWho was born first out of Misaele Draunibaka and Ross Clark?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\" of \"Gitanjali\", he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\". A Brahmo from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym \"Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43haSun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University. Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. \" GitanjaliSong OfferingsGoraFair-Faced\") and \"Ghare-BaireThe Home and the World\") are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed\u2014or panned\u2014for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's \"Jana Gana Mana\" and Bangladesh's \"Amar Shonar Bangla\". The Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work.\n\nWhere did the director of film The Price Of Everything study?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

The story of the Bull of Heaven has two different versions: one recorded in an earlier Sumerian poem and a later version in the standard Akkadian\" Epic of Gilgamesh\". In the Sumerian poem, the Bull is sent to attack Gilgamesh by the goddess Inanna for reasons that are unclear. The more complete Akkadian account comes from Tablet VI of the\" Epic of Gilgamesh\", in which Gilgamesh rejects the sexual advances of the goddess Ishtar, the East Semitic equivalent of Inanna, leading the enraged Ishtar to demand her father Anu for the Bull of Heaven, so that she may send it to attack Gilgamesh in Uruk. Anu gives her the Bull and she sends it to attack Gilgamesh and his companion, the hero Enkidu, who slay the Bull together. After defeating the Bull, Enkidu hurls the Bull's right thigh at Ishtar, taunting her. The slaying of the Bull results in the gods condemning Enkidu to death, an event which catalyzes Gilgamesh's fear for his own death, which drives the remaining portion of the epic. The Bull was identified with the constellation Taurus and the myth of its slaying may have held astronomical significance to the ancient Mesopotamians. Aspects of the story have been compared to later tales from the ancient Near East, including legends from Ugarit, the tale of Joseph in the Book of Genesis, and parts of the ancient Greek epics, the\" Iliad\" and the\" Odyssey\".\n\nChonghai Bridge\nChonghai Bridge () is a bridge, located at , spanning the northern distributary of the Yangtze River in China that is currently under construction.

Bob Dylan asked Mansfield to tour with him on his 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour; he remained in Dylan's band through their 1978 world tour. After the Revue ended in 1976, Mansfield and two other members of Dylan's band, T-Bone Burnett and Steven Soles, formed The Alpha Band. The band released three albums, \"The Alpha Band\" in 1977, \"Spark in the Dark\" in 1977, and \"The Statue Makers of Hollywood\" in 1978. While Mansfield in 1978 was working on the album, \"The Statue Makers of Hollywood\" with The Alpha Band, he appeared as a guitarist on \"Desire Wire\" by a struggling pop/rock artist Cindy Bullens that same year. In 1986 Mansfield was an initial member of Bruce Hornsby and the Range, including playing the title instrument on the hit \"Mandolin Rain\". However, he left the Range before their first tour. Since The Alpha Band broke up, Mansfield has continued to work as a musician in sessions for Dylan, Burnett, Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith, Roger McGuinn, Sam Phillips, Mark Heard, The Roches, Edie Brickell, Spinal Tap, Lucinda Williams, Dwight Yoakam, Victoria Williams, Loudon Wainwright III, Willie Nile, Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen and others.

He is an early pioneer of independent cinema.

At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival which garnered the film worldwide commercial success, among numerous accolades. His breakthrough saw him to Hollywood where he directed crime comedy \"Out of Sight\" (1998); biopic \"Erin Brockovich\" (2000) and crime drama film \"Traffic\" (2000), the latter winning him the Academy Award for Best Director. He found further popular and critical success with the \"Ocean's\" trilogy and film franchise (2001\u201318); \"Contagion\" (2011); \"Magic Mike\" (2012); \"Side Effects\" (2013); \"Logan Lucky\" (2017); and \"Unsane\" (2018). Despite his film career spanning a multitude of genres, his cinematic niche centers on psychological, crime, and heist thrillers. His films have grossed over US$2.2 billion worldwide and garnered nine Oscar nominations, winning seven. Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts often used for big budget Hollywood movies but with an avant garde arthouse approach to them. They center on the themes of shifting personal identities, vengeance, sexuality, morality, and the human condition. His feature films retain distinctive cinematography as a result of his liberal use of avant-garde cinema coupled with unconventional film and camera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines with plot twists, nonlinear storytelling, experimental sequencing, suspenseful soundscapes, and third person vantage points. Uniquely, he often serves as his own director of photography and editor under the respective pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard.\n\nThe Vice Squad\nThe Vice Squad is a 1931 American Pre- Code drama film directed by John Cromwell, written by Oliver H.P.

Herbert was born in Brisbane, to botanist Desmond Herbert and his wife, Vera Prowse (the daughter of John Henry Prowse, a federal politician from Western Australia). His sister Joan would also become a botanist like their father. In 1943, Herbert enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy where he served in the Indian Ocean, Burma, New Guinea, and the Admiralty Islands until his discharge from the naval base in March 1946. He then worked as a bank clerk for the English, Scottish and Australian Bank (ES&A), and was involved in the anti-bank nationalisation campaign of 1947. He was a member of the Liberal Party, and was a member of the party's state executive from 1950 until 1956 when he successfully ran for election in the electoral district of Sherwood. He served in various ministerial positions from 1965 to 1978, holding the portfolios of labour, tourism, sport and welfare services.

Jeanette MacDonald had been off the screen for five years until her return in\" Three Daring Daughters\"( 1948), but\" The Sun Comes Up\" was to be her last. In it, she had to share the screen not with an up- and- coming younger actress but with a very popular animal star. Although her retreat from a film career can be blamed largely on an increasingly debilitating heart ailment( which eventually took her life at the age of 61 in 1965), MacDonald continued to make concert and TV appearances after this. Her last radio performance was a broadcast version of this same story on Screen Guild Theater in March 1950.\n\nJos\u00e9 Alberto \"El Canario\"\nJos\u00e9 Alberto Justiniano born December 22, 1959 in Villa Consuelo, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, better known by his stage name Jos\u00e9 Alberto\" El Canario\", is a salsa singer from the Dominican Republic.

Scullin led Labor to government at the 1929 election. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 transpired just two days after his swearing in, which would herald the beginning of the Great Depression in Australia. Scullin's administration would soon be overwhelmed by the economic crisis, with interpersonal and policy disagreements causing a three- way split of his party that would bring down the government in late 1931. Despite his chaotic term of office, Scullin remained a leading figure in the Labor movement throughout his lifetime, and served as an\" \u00e9minence grise\" in various capacities for the party until his retirement in 1949. The son of working- class Irish- immigrants, Scullin spent much of his early life as a laborer and grocer in Ballarat. An autodidact and passionate debater, Scullin would join the Australian Labor Party in 1903, beginning a career spanning five decades. He was a political organizer and newspaper editor for the party, and was elected to the House of Representatives first in 1910 and then again in 1922 until 1949. Scullin quickly established himself as a leading voice in parliament, rapidly rising to become deputy leader of the party in 1927 and then Leader of the Opposition in 1928. After Scullin had won a landslide election in 1929, events took a dramatic change with the crisis on Wall Street and the rapid onset of the Great Depression around the world, which hit heavily indebted Australia hard. Scullin and his Treasurer Ted Theodore responded by developing several plans during 1930 and 1931 to repay foreign debt, provide relief to farmers and create economic stimulus to curb unemployment based on deficit spending and expansionary monetary policy. Although the Keynesian Revolution would see these ideas adopted by most Western nations by the end of the decade, in 1931 such ideas were considered radical and the plans were bitterly opposed by many who feared hyperinflation and economic ruin. The still opposition- dominated Senate, and the conservative- dominated boards of the Commonwealth Bank and Loan Council, repeatedly blocked the plans. With the prospect of bankruptcy facing the government, Scullin backed down and instead advanced the Premiers' Plan, a far more conservative measure that met the crisis with severe cutbacks in government spending. Pensioners and other core Labor constituencies were severely affected by the cuts, leading to a widespread revolt and multiple defections in parliament. After several months of infighting the government collapsed, and was resoundingly defeated by the newly formed United Australia Party at the subsequent 1931 election. Scullin would remain party leader for four more years but the party split would not be healed until after Scullin's return to the backbenches in 1935. Scullin became a respected elder voice within the party and leading authority on taxation and government finance, and would eventually play a significant role in reforming both when Labor returned to government in 1941. Although disappointed with his own term of office, he nonetheless lived long enough to see many of his government's ideas implemented by subsequent governments before his death in 1953.\n\nGuido Seeber\nGuido Seeber (22 June 1879 in Chemnitz \u2013 2 July 1940 in Berlin) was a German cinematographer and pioneer of early cinema.\n\nEdward Leech (MP)\nSir Edward Leech or Leche( 1572 \u2013 1652) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1614 and 1625.\n\nKamen\u0161ko\nKamen\u0161ko is a small village in the Municipality of Sevnica in southeastern Slovenia.

Arthur on May 6, 1882, prohibiting all immigration of Chinese laborers. The act followed the Angell Treaty of 1880, a set of revisions to the U.S. -- China Burlingame Treaty of 1868 that allowed the U.S. to suspend Chinese immigration. The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902.

Completed in 1948, it is the first in a series of six heads, the remainder of which were painted the following year in preparation for a November 1949 exhibition at the Hanover Gallery in London. Like the others in the series, it shows a screaming figure alone in a room, and focuses on the open mouth. The work shows a skull which has disintegrated on itself and is largely a formless blob of flesh. The entire upper half has disappeared, leaving only the jaw, mouth and teeth and one ear still intact. It is the first of Bacon's paintings to feature gold background railings or bars; later to become a prominent feature of his 1950s work, especially in the papal portraits where they would often appear as enclosing or cages around the figures. It is not known what influences were behind the image; most likely they were multiple\u00a0\u2013 press or war photography, and critic Denis Farr detects the influence of Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald.\n\nErich Zakowski\nErich Zakowski (born 25 November 1934 in East Prussia) is a German master mechanic, and the founder and longtime head of the Zakspeed racing team.\n\nThomas Phillips (disambiguation)\nThomas Phillips( 1770 \u2013 1845) was an English painter.

It was removed from there as part of the \"cleansing\" of modern art works under the Nazis, and included in the \"Degenerate Art\" exhibition which opened in July 1937 in Munich. However, in response to a protest by veterans because Marc had died fighting for his country in the war, the painting was removed and was not included in the exhibition when it opened in Berlin. At that time it was valued at 80,000 Reichsmarks. In spring 1936, now valued at 20,000 RM, it was then transferred to Hermann G\u00f6ring's custody as part of a select group of valuable modernist paintings which also included two other works by Marc. G\u00f6ring sold at least some of these at a considerable profit, but appears not to have sold \"The Tower of Blue Horses\", which went missing at war's end.\n\nWhich country Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince Of Conti's father is from?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Her name in Greek translates to \" Athenais the loving one\". The child of King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his second marriage to the Anatolian Greek Macedonian noblewoman and Pontian Queen Monime, she was a princess of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. Born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontos, her parents gave her a traditional ancient Greek name. Athenais married the Cappadocian Prince and later King Ariobarzanes II Philopator, who was of Persian and Greek descent. Ariobarzanes II succeeded his father as King in 63 BC-62 BC, when his father Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios abdicated his throne. When Ariobarzanes II became king, Athenais became Cappadocian queen, inheriting the honorific title of \"Philostorgos\", which was the honorific surname of the mother of Ariobarzanes II, Athenais Philostorgos I. Athenais was related to the previous kings and monarchs of Cappadocia. Her paternal aunt Laodice of Cappadocia was a queen, her paternal cousins, Ariarathes VI, Ariarathes VII, and Ariarathes VIII, and her paternal half-brother Ariarathes IX all served as previous kings of Cappadocia. Through her Seleucid and paternal lineage, Athenais was related to the ancestors of Ariarathes VI. Ariobarzanes II reigned as king of Cappadocia from c. 63 BC-62 BC until his assassination in c. 51 BC. There are various surviving honorific inscriptions dedicated to Athenais. During their marriage, Athenais bore Ariobarzanes II two sons: Ariobarzanes III Eusebes Philoromaios and Ariarathes X Eusebes Philadelphos. Her sons would serve as among the last kings of Cappadocia. The name \"Ariobarzanes\" was not only a name from her husband's family, but also a name from her own family. Athenais had three paternal political ancestors of that name: Ariobarzanes of Phrygia, who flourished 5th century BC, Ariobarzanes II of Cius, who flourished 4th century BC, and the previous Pontian King Ariobarzanes of Pontus. After the death of her husband, her first son succeeded his father as King and she became a widow who never married again. Athenais became known as the \u2018Queen-Mother\u2019 of Cappadocia. During the rule of Ariobarzanes III, Roman Governor of Cilicia Marcus Tullius Cicero warned the King that Athenais could be a potential enemy to him. Cicero's warning was based on Athenais\u2019 jealousy, about two nobles called Methras and Athenaeus. They were ministers and favorites of her first son and they were through Athenais\u2019 jealousy were driven out from the Cappadocian Royal Court. However, Methras and Athenaeus were later recalled by Cicero. Athenais\u2019 jealousy was a part of her failed plot to depose her first son from his throne and put her second son in his place. Cicero and Ariobarzanes III caught Athenais out and Ariobarzanes III was very saddened by his mother's actions. Ariabarzanes III removed his mother from power and her fate afterward is unknown.\n\nSomebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)\nSomebody Up There Likes Me is a 1956 American drama film based on the life of middleweight boxing legend Rocky Graziano.

Ad\u00e9lina was the daughter of Marie Michel L\u00e9v\u00eaque, a Haitian of mixed-race heritage. She had a long-term relationship with Faustin Souloque for many years. It was only on 31 December 1847 that Ad\u00e9lina married her long-time companion Emperor Faustin. On 26 August 1849 she was given the title Empress of Haiti with the style of Her Imperial Majesty, and crowned with her husband at the capital Port-au-Prince on 18 April 1852: both emperor and empress were crowned in an immense and lavish ceremony that emulated the coronation of the French Napoleon I of France. Her sister was styled Her Serene Highness Princess Cl\u00e9lia. They had two daughters: As Empress, Adelina was given her own court, composed of a grand almoner, two ladies of honor, two tirewomen, 56 ladies of the palace, 22 ladies of the chapel, chamberlains and pages: all the female courtiers came from the newly appointed nobility of Faustin and had the titles duchess, countess, baroness or marchioness. She performed representational duties, such as receiving in state, or giving audiences, every Tuesday. In 1858 a revolution began, led by General Fabre Geffrard, Duc de Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country. As a result, the emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation , Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859. Soon afterwards, the emperor and his family arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, where they remained for several years. Allowed to return to Ha\u00efti, Faustin died at Petit-Go\u00e2ve on 6 August 1867 and was buried at Fort Soulouque.\n\nSilver Lake, New York\nSilver Lake, New York may refer to:\n\n1973 oil crisis\nThe USSR's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region, also marked by increased American weapons sales, technology, and outright military presence. Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\"\n\nSarah Herring Sorin\nSarah Herring Sorin( January 15, 1861 \u2013 April 30, 1914) was Arizona's first woman attorney and the first woman to try a case in front of the United States Supreme Court unassisted by a male attorney.

Its standard designation is \"Codex a\" (or 3 in the Beuron system of numeration). The order of the gospels in this Codex is Matthew, John, Luke and Mark, which is also found in some other very old \"Western\" manuscripts, such as Codex Bezae. In its text of Matthew 3, before verse 16, there is a statement that a light suddenly shone when Jesus was baptized (Et cum baptizaretur, lumen ingens circumfulsit de aqua, ita ut timerent omnes qui advenerant). It contains the last twelve verses of the Gospel of Mark, but on a replacement-page. The original final pages after Mark 15:15 have been lost, and the replacement-page resumes mid-sentence in 16:7 and includes the text to the end of verse 20, but in the Vulgate version. Space considerations suggest that it is unlikely that the original, non-extant pages included verses 9-20, but this calculation (made by C. H. Turner in 1928) depends on unverifiable assumptions that only four pages have been lost, that the scribe did not accidentally skip any text, and that the person who made the replacement-page had access to the missing page that it replaced. However Turner did not explain why a scribe would replace only one of four pages. It is more probable that the replacement-page was removed from another manuscript than that it was made to insert in Codex Vercellensis. The text of Codex Vercellensis is related to the text of Codex Corbeiensis (ff), another Old Latin copy (in which Mk 16:9-20 is included).\n\nElena Tedesco\nElena Isabella Tedesco Bardi (born October 15, 1991 in San Salvador, El Salvador) is a Salvadoran beauty queen who won the Nuestra Belleza Mundo El Salvador pageant in 2009.

Founded in 1928, The Little is one of the oldest active movie theaters built specifically to show films in the US, serving as an alternative venue for cinema of higher artistic caliber than what was popular at the time. To remain in business, The Little has created a unique theater experience for its patrons strikingly different from that of standard commercial cinemas. The Little typically shows films that never make it to the large theater chains, either due to lack of publicity, popularity, exposure, or content that is too risky and/ or inappropriate for larger audiences( such as NC- 17 rated films). Foreign films, independent films, some documentary films and art films are its common fare. The Little is unique in the area in treating anime films as artistic cinema, and titles by the likes of Hayao Miyazaki always find their way to The Little's screens. Critics at The Little provide a synopsis of any film they intend to show, both on their website and posted around their ticket booths on the street. The Little also offers live musical performances from local musicians, a rotating art gallery of local artists, and a cafe. Additionally, The Little serves as a performance venue during the Rochester International Jazz Festival each June. The Little is also the home of the Little Theatre Film Society, a group of theater aficionados in the Rochester area. The Little survives largely due to the hard work and dedication of the society's members. The theater is currently operated with the participation of the WXXI Public Broadcasting Council, a non-profit community organization which owns and operates the region's principal public radio and television stations. The Little has become part of Rochester's extensive theater culture. Rochester has a rich history in cinema, being the home of the Eastman Kodak company and the George Eastman Museum. Kodak film was historically used in a majority of motion pictures( and still is today), creating close ties to the movie industry in Rochester society. The Little Theatre Film Society holds film festivals throughout the year, many of them hosted at The Little. The theatre is well known by any serious cinema patron in Rochester for providing an alternative to standard Hollywood commercial fare. The Little has also avoided the negative reputation for snobbishness that is sometimes associated with art house cinema, cultivating the image of a venue for anyone who is simply seeking an alternative or a community that celebrates cinema. The word\" Theatre\" is often used instead of the word\" Theater\" to distinguish between art house cinemas and the more common variety. Theatre is an older form of the word, though both words share the same literal meaning. The Little uses the older form both to make this distinction and due to the age of the theater itself.\n\nWhere was the performer of song Suicide Social born?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He studied at Fairmont State Normal School and graduated from the West Virginia University law school in 1897. After establishing a law practice in Fairmont, Morgan enlisted in the First West Virginia Infantry during the Spanish\u2013American War. Following the war, he became the Fairmont city attorney. He served as a judge of the Marion County Intermediate Court from 1907 to 1912 and as a member of the West Virginia Public Service Commission from 1915 to 1920. In 1902, he married Alma Bennett. At the time Morgan became governor, a virtual state of war existed between union coal miners and coal operators. The United Mine Workers union was protesting for the right to organize miners in the southwestern part of the state. In late summer 1921, the governor called upon President Warren G. Harding to dispatch federal troops to end an armed miners' march in Boone and Logan counties. After the conflict ended, Morgan used National Guard troops to discourage miners from again taking up arms. A more detailed discussion of the 1921 armed miners' march and the Battle of Blair Mountain can be found in Clayton D. Laurie's \"The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920\u20131921\" in \"West Virginia History\", Volume 50 (1991).

He appointed a Capitol Commission to devise a plan for replacing the old state capitol, which was destroyed by fire on January 3, 1921. The west wing of the present state capitol was completed in 1925. One week before leaving office, Ephraim and Alma Morgan became the first residents of the present West Virginia Governor's Mansion. After his term as governor, Morgan served as solicitor for the United States Department of Commerce before retiring in Fairmont, West Virginia.

By the time the first subway opened, the lines had been consolidated into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn -- Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). Many present lines were built under the Dual Contracts, and after 1913, all lines built for the IRT and most other lines built or improved for the BRT were built by the city and leased to the companies. The first line of the city - owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended to compete with the private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down. However, it was kept within the core of the city because of the low amount of startup capital provided to the municipal Board of Transportation by the state. This required it to be run ``at cost '', necessitating fares up to double the five - cent fare popular at the time.\n\nSave the Green Planet!\nSave the Green Planet!

Supplied by the Soviet Union, from late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov -- Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz bombing campaign, and the Balkan Campaign, as well as the long - running Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history, which trapped the major part of the Axis military forces into a war of attrition.

Rather, one electron accumulates on the negative plate for each one that leaves the positive plate, resulting in an electron depletion and consequent positive charge on one electrode that is equal and opposite to the accumulated negative charge on the other. Thus the charge on the electrodes is equal to the integral of the current as well as proportional to the voltage, as discussed above. As with any antiderivative, a constant of integration is added to represent the initial voltage V(t0). This is the integral form of the capacitor equation:\n\nLeague of Nations\nFollowing a long record of instigating localised conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937.

He succeeded his father, King Sejo in 1468 at 18 years of age (19 according to Korean system), but was too physically ill to govern, and died a year later. One of the most prominent incidents during Yejong's reign was the trial and death of General Nam I (\ub0a8\uc774 \uc7a5\uad70, \u5357\u6021). Nam-I was famous for having suppressed Yi Si-ae rebellion along with General Gang-Sun and others. At age 28, he was appointed to Minister of War. However, when Yejong became king, a minister named Yu Jagwang (\uc720\uc790\uad11, \u67f3\u5b50\u5149) who was jealous of Nam I accused him of treason when he found out that Yejong himself was not fond of Nam I.

Chiang received the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party; however, he soon dismissed his Soviet advisors. He was convinced, not without reason, that they wanted to get rid of the KMT (also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party) and take over. Chiang decided to strike first and purged the Communists, killing thousands of them. At the same time, other violent conflicts took place in the south of China where the Communist Party fielded superior numbers and were massacring Nationalist supporters. These events eventually led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party. Chiang Kai - shek pushed the Communist Party into the interior as he sought to destroy them, and moved the Nationalist Government to Nanjing in 1927. Leftists within the KMT still allied to the communists, lead by Wang Jingwei, had established a rival Nationalist Government in Wuhan two months earlier, but soon joined Chiang in Nanjing in August 1927. By the following year, Chiang's army had captured Beijing after overthrowing the Beiyang government and unified the entire nation, at least nominally, marking the beginning the Nanjing Decade.\n\nDylan Walshe\nDylan Walshe is an Irish folk music singer- songwriter.

She is considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first country music artists to successfully crossover into pop music. Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country and Western Sides chart. Cline's first professional performances began at the local WINC radio station when she was fifteen. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on Connie B. Gay's \"Town and Country\" television broadcasts. It also led to the signing of her first recording contract with the Four Star label in 1954. She had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including \"A Church, A Courtroom and Goodbye\" (1955) and \"I've Loved and Lost Again\" (1956). In 1957 however, Cline made her first national television appearance on \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\". After performing \"Walkin' After Midnight\", the single would become her first major hit on both the country and pop charts. Cline's further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. After marrying in 1957 and giving birth in 1958, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline would become a member of the Grand Ole Opry and then move to Decca Records in 1960. Under the direction of producer Owen Bradley, her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single \"I Fall to Pieces\" would become her first to top the \"Billboard\" country chart. As the song became a hit, Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After recovering, her next single release \"Crazy\" would also become a major hit. Between 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with \" She's Got YouWhen I Get Through with YouSo Wrong\" and \"Leavin' on Your Mind\". She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. In March 1963, Cline appeared at a benefit show in Kansas City, Missouri. To return home, she boarded a plane along with country performers Cowboy Copas, Hawkshaw Hawkins and manager Randy Hughes. Upon hitting rough weather, the plane crashed outside of Camden, Tennessee, killing all those on board. Since her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres. She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In the 1980s, Cline's posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic \"Sweet Dreams\" starring Jessica Lange. Several documentaries and stage shows were released during this time, including the 1988 musical \" Always... Patsy Cline\".

It is among the earliest extant log churches in Hampshire County, along with Capon Chapel and Mount Bethel Church. The church was constructed in 1838 to serve as a nondenominational\" union church\". As many of the Mill Creek valley's earliest settlers were of German descent, Old Pine Church may also have been built as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents, known as\" Dunkers\" or\" Dunkards\". The church is believed to have also been a meeting place for German Methodist settlers. By 1870, the church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination, and in 1878, the church's congregation split into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church congregations. Both congregations continued to use the church until 1907. Old Pine Church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship. In 1968, residents of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to perform a restoration of the church. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, due to its\" significant settlement- era rural religious architecture in the Potomac Highlands.\" The church is a large, one- story, gablefront log building sheathed in brown- painted wooden German siding. The original hewn log beams are visible beneath the church, with some bark remaining on the logs. The church's interior ceiling measures approximately in height and is clad in pressed metal panels. Several of its pews date from 1857. In the church's adjoining cemetery, the earliest extant gravestone dates from 1834, and several unmarked interment sites may exist from as early as 1759.

He is also the current Chairman of India's multi-national film, media and entertainment conglomerate Yash Raj Films (YRF). Chopra has written and produced a number of films under the banner such as \"Veer-Zaara\" (2004), \"Fanaa\" (2006), \"Band Baaja Baaraat\" (2010), \" Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" (2012), the \"Dhoom series\" (2004, 2006 & 2013), \"Sultan\" (2016), the \"Tiger series\" (2012 & 2017) and \"War\" (2019). He has broken away from typecast through production of off-beat films such as \"Kabul Express\" (2006), \"Chak De! India\" (2007),  (2009) , \"Dum Laga Ke Haisha\" (2015) and \"Hichki!\" (2018), that do not necessarily fit into the realm of \"masala films\". Chopra is also the first to move towards a true film studio model through independent projects helmed by talent under his banner. Major post-production work of the company is now carried out of YRF Studios (co-founded by his ex-wife Payal Khanna), where Chopra serves as Chief Executive. He has produced ten films that have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of more than 200 crore, which is the most for an Indian film producer. In December 2009, Chopra fought a hostile acquisition bid by Walt Disney, valued upwards of 2500 crore, to remain and continue purely as a domestic entity aided by the Tata Sons. Apart from emerging as an equitable brand, his company has earned the status of a movie mogul through distribution networks spread across the globe, estimated to be net worth 7640 crore (FY17/18) by the NSE, thereby making it the biggest and most successful film production company in the history of Indian Cinema. Having denied him admission into the NSD as a young applicant, the Directorate of Film Festivals eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2005, 2007 and 2015. The Government of India appealed both Chopra and Mani Ratnam to focus on content created locally under its Make in India initiative, which was later followed by productions like \"Daawat-e-Ishq\" (2014), \"Meri Pyaari Bindu\" (2016), \"Sui-Dhaaga\" (2018) and \"Jayeshbhai Jordaar\" (2020) planned by his company. In June 2018, he was awarded membership into The Academy by the Producers Guild of America. Widely regarded as one of the most influential and powerful executives in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra's son and the Chief Executive of Yash Raj Films.

Fackenthal\nFrank Diehl Fackenthal( February 22, 1883 \u2013 September 5, 1968) was an American academic administrator best known for his long association with Columbia University. He was of Pennsylvania Dutch descent and resided for much of his life in Brooklyn, New York. A self- described\" able C man\", Fackenthal graduated from Boys High School in 1902 before earning his undergraduate degree from Columbia College in 1906. As a student, his prodigious administrative abilities( reflected by his leadership in various campus organizations, including the Varsity Show and the\" Columbia Daily Spectator\") were recognized by president Nicholas Murray Butler, leading to his career as chief clerk( 1906 \u2013 1910), secretary( 1910 \u2013 1937), and provost( 1937 \u2013 1948) of the University. As secretary and provost, he was the\" de facto\" administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes from their inception until 1948; following his retirement, he received a special Prize in recognition of his service. Previously, Fackenthal received an honorary LL.D. from Franklin& Marshall College( a recipient of familial philanthropy) and an honorary Litt.D. from Columbia in 1929. Although he never completed an earned graduate degree, he was frequently characterized in the press thereafter as\" Dr. Fackenthal.\" He later received honorary doctorates from Syracuse University, Rutgers University, New York University and Union College. Between the retirement of Nicholas Murray Butler in 1945 and the installation of Dwight D. Eisenhower as president in 1948, Fackenthal served as acting president while retaining his post as provost. Although several trustees considered motioning for his permanent appointment, this was forestalled by the ailing Butler, who considered Fackenthal( whom he publicly deprecated as\" my clerk\") to be unworthy of the position. Despite this acrimony, Fackenthal was elected to the university's board of trustees against Butler's wishes in 1946 in an unprecedented breach of longstanding tradition. As acting president, Fackenthal developed a plan for Columbia's continued growth that was\" largely eschewed by his successors\", presaging the tumult of Grayson Kirk's administration and the Columbia University protests of 1968. He also oversaw the formation of the School of General Studies( for nontraditional undergraduates and nonmatriculated students), the graduate- level School of International Affairs and the Harriman Institute. Following his retirement from the University in 1948, he served as educational consultant to the Carnegie Corporation( 1948 \u2013 1952) and then as president of Columbia University Press( 1953 \u2013 1958). He also served as president of the Bushwick Savings Bank and remained a trustee of various institutions, including Columbia, Barnard College, Franklin and Marshall College and the Riverdale Country School. His principal speeches as acting president were published by Columbia University Press as\" The Greater Power and Other Addresses\"( 1949). In December 1965, he was critically injured when his car collided with a truck in White Township, New Jersey, 35 miles south of his country home in Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania. As a result of his injuries, Fackenthal( who never married and had no legitimate children) was forced to permanently relocate from Brooklyn to Buck Hill Falls.

This extension was developed at Fraunhofer IIS, the registered MP3 patent holders. Like MPEG-2, MPEG-2.5 adds new sampling rates exactly half of that previously possible with MPEG-2. It thus widens the scope of MP3 to include human speech and other applications requiring only 25% of the frequency reproduction possible with MPEG-1. While not an ISO recognized standard, MPEG-2.5 is widely supported by both inexpensive and brand name digital audio players as well as computer software based MP3 encoders and decoders. A sample rate comparison between MPEG-1, 2 and 2.5 is given further down. MPEG-2.5 was not developed by MPEG and was never approved as an international standard. MPEG-2.5 is thus an unofficial or proprietary extension to the MP3 format.\n\nWhich film has the director born later, La Soif De L'Or or Forelsket I K\u00f8benhavn?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Directed by Patty Jenkins from a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs, \"Wonder Woman\" stars Gal Gadot in the title role, alongside Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, and Elena Anaya. It is the second live action theatrical film featuring Wonder Woman following her debut in 2016's . In \"Wonder Woman\", the Amazon princess Diana sets out to stop World War I, believing the conflict was started by the longtime enemy of the Amazons, Ares, after American pilot and spy Steve Trevor crash-lands on their island Themyscira and informs her about it. Development of a live action Wonder Woman film began in 1996, with Ivan Reitman slated to produce and possibly direct. The project floundered in development hell for many years; Jon Cohen, Todd Alcott, and Joss Whedon, among others, were also attached to the project at various points. Warner Bros. announced the film in 2010 and Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Inspiration for \"Wonder Woman\" was drawn from Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston's 1940s stories and George P\u00e9rez's 1980s stories about Wonder Woman, as well as the New 52 incarnation of the character. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before finishing on May 6, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of Marston's birth. Additional filming took place in November 2016. \"Wonder Woman\" had its world premiere in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, Real D 3D, and IMAX 3D by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received largely positive reviews, with praise for its direction, acting, visuals, action sequences, and musical score. The film set several box office records, and became the fifth highest-grossing superhero film domestically and 20th highest-grossing film in the United States overall. It grossed over $821 million worldwide, making it the tenth highest-grossing film of 2017. As of August 2019, Rotten Tomatoes has listed the film fourth on its list of the \"Best Superhero Movies of All Time\", and the American Film Institute selected it as one of the top 10 films of 2017. A sequel, \"Wonder Woman 1984\", is scheduled to be released on June 5, 2020, with Jenkins returning as director, and Gadot and Pine reprising their roles.\n\nBiker Boyz\nBiker Boyz is a 2003 American film about a group of underground motorcycle drag racers.

He directed classic films from the silent era and numerous others during Hollywood's Golden Age, when the studio system was prevalent. Curtiz was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio. He directed 102 films during his Hollywood career, mostly at Warners, where he directed ten actors to Oscar nominations. James Cagney and Joan Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz's direction. He put Doris Day and John Garfield on screen for the first time, and he made stars of Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Bette Davis. He himself was nominated five times and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for \"Sons of Liberty\" and once as Best Director for \"Casablanca\". Curtiz introduced to Hollywood a unique visual style using artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles. He was versatile and could handle any kind of picture: melodrama, comedy, love story, film noir, musical, war story, Western, or historical epic. He always paid attention to the human-interest aspect of every story, stating that the \"human and fundamental problems of real people\" were the basis of all good drama. Curtiz helped popularize the classic swashbuckler with films such as \"Captain Blood\" (1935) and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). He directed many dramas which today are also considered classics, \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938), \"The Sea Wolf\" (1941), \"Casablanca\" (1942), and \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945).

The second son of Roger Boyle, 2nd Earl of Orrery, and his wife Lady Mary Sackville (1647\u20131710), daughter of Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset, he was born at Little Chelsea, London. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and soon distinguished himself by his learning and abilities. Like the first earl, he was an author, soldier and statesman. He translated Plutarch's life of Lysander, and published an edition of the epistles of Phalaris, which engaged him in the famous controversy with Bentley. He was a member of the Irish Parliament and sat for Charleville between 1695 and 1699. He was three times member for the town of Huntingdon; and on the death of his brother, Lionel, 3rd earl, in 1703, he succeeded to the title. He entered the army, and in 1709 was raised to the rank of major-general, and sworn one of Her Majesty's Privy Council. He was appointed to the Order of the Thistle and appointed queen's envoy to the states of Brabant and Flanders; and having discharged this trust with ability, he was created an English peer, as Baron Boyle of Marston, in Somerset. He inherited the estate in 1714. Boyle became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1706. In 1713, under the patronage of Boyle, clockmaker George Graham created the first mechanical solar system model that could demonstrate proportional motion of the planets around the Sun. The device was named the orrery in the Earl's honour. Charles Boyle received several additional honours in the reign of George I; but having had the misfortune to fall under the suspicion of the government for playing a part in the Jacobite Atterbury Plot, he was committed to the Tower in 1722, where he remained six months, and was then admitted to bail. On a subsequent inquiry he was discharged. Boyle wrote a comedy, \"As you find it\", printed in 1703 and later published together with the plays of the first earl. In 1728, he was listed as one of the subscribers to the \"Cyclopaedia\" of Ephraim Chambers. Boyle died at his house in Westminster in 1731 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He bequeathed his personal library and collection of scientific instruments to Christ Church Library; the instruments are now on display in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. His son John, the 5th Earl of Orrery, succeeded to the earldom of Cork on the failure of the elder branch of the Boyle family, as earl of Cork and Orrery.\n\nGornja Lu\u010dka\nGornja Lu\u010dka is a village in the municipality of Cazin, Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nAlice Gets Stung\nAlice Gets Stung is a 1925 animated short film by Walt Disney in the \"Alice Comedies\" series.

In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" sound.\n\nOmbudsman\nThe Local Government Ombudsman (formally the Commission for Local Government Administration -- there are two Commissioners) for England and Wales was created in 1973, and a similar office for Scotland in 1974; since then, a variety of other public and private sector - specific ombudsmen have been created, along with the Northern Ireland Ombudsman.\n\nWho is Shepseskare's paternal grandmother?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

Bush, who served as the 41st president from 1989 to 1993. Bush is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States, making him the second son to also become president after his father, the first being John Quincy Adams. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected President of the United States in 2000 when he defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a stopped recount in Florida. He became the fourth person to be elected president while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent. In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush launched a \"War on Terror\" that initially included the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and the Iraq War in 2003. He signed into law broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. In the 2004 presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator John Kerry in a close election. After his re-election, Bush received criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the \"Great Recession\", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Bush was among the most popular, as well as unpopular, U.S. presidents in history; he received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but one of the lowest such ratings during the 2008 financial crisis. Bush finished his term in office in 2009 and returned to Texas. In 2010, he published his memoir, \"Decision Points\". His presidential library opened in 2013.

A guitar virtuoso known for his genre-crossing work, falsetto singing voice and flamboyant stage appearances, Prince is regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time. His innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, rock, R&B, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop. Prince pioneered the late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from synth-pop and new wave. Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song, \"Funk Machine\", at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album \" For You\" in 1978. Followed with his next four albums \u2014 \"Prince\" (1979), \"Dirty Mind\" (1980), \"Controversy\" (1981), and \"1999\" (1982)\u2014Prince gained critical success, prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as blending of funk, dance, and rock music.

It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful record, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the \"Billboard\" 200. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, the last to receive the award. Following the disbandment of The Revolution, Prince released the critically acclaimed double album \"Sign o' the Times\" (1987). He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol , also known as the \"Love Symbol\", and began releasing new albums at a faster rate in order to quickly meet a contractually required quota and therefore release himself from further obligations to the record label. He released five records between 1994 and 1996 before he signed with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as \"Prince\" again. He subsequently released 16 albums, including \"Musicology\" (2004), which was his most successful album of the 2000s. His final album, \"Hit n Run Phase Two\", was first released on the Tidal streaming service in 2015. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota.

He won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was also honored with special awards including the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Award for Achievement and of Merit, and the \"Billboard\" Icon Award.

Also known as George Tressler, Hans Tressler, Hans Dressler, Hans Georg Keil and Hans Sternbeck( per IMDb). The son of actor Otto Tressler, he began his acting career in the 1930s. George Tressler was drafted into the German army during World War II and served on the Russian Front. He became ill and was released from the service and returned to Vienna. Tressler turned to directing films in the mid-1940s. He directed nearly 80 movies during his lifetime, including\" The Death Ship\"( 1959) with Horst Buchholz and Mario Adorf. He came to Hollywood and directed Disney's\" The Magnificent Rebel\"( 1962). Other works include\" Teenage Wolfpack\"( 1956) and\" 2069: A Sex Odyssey\"( 1974).

He is widely regarded as the most influential and controversial politician in Mexico over the last 30 years. Earlier in his career he worked in the Budget Secretariat, eventually becoming Secretary. He was the PRI presidential candidate in 1988, and was declared elected on 6 July 1988 after accusations of electoral fraud. An economist, Salinas de Gortari was the first Mexican president since 1958 who was not a law graduate. His presidency was characterized by neoliberal, free trade economic policies initiated by his predecessor Miguel de la Madrid, mass privatizations of state- run companies, Mexico's entry into NAFTA, negotiations with the right- wing opposition party PAN to recognize their victories in gubernatorial elections in exchange for supporting Salinas' policies, normalization of relations with the Catholic clergy, and the adoption of a new currency, among other things. After years of economic growth, however, his last year in office revealed Salinas had failed to address social inequity in the country, quickly followed by revelations of Salinas's mismanagement. The year 1994 saw the Zapatista uprising, the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio( Salinas's hand- picked successor and PRI candidate for the 1994 presidential elections), and the murder of secretary- general of the PRI Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu( Salinas's brother- in- law). This surge of political violence led to economic uncertainty. Facing pressures to devalue the peso, Salinas stood firm, opting for a strategy he believed would help his candidacy for the presidency of the newly created World Trade Organization. As a consequence, less than a month after Salinas left office, Mexico entered into the worst economic crisis of its history. Shortly after, his brother Ra\u00fal Salinas de Gortari was arrested for ordering the assassination of Ruiz Massieu and was subsequently indicted on charges of drug trafficking. Carlos Salinas de Gortari then left the country for many years. Salinas de Gortari is often referred to as the most unpopular former president of Mexico. A 2005 nationwide poll conducted by Parametr\u00eda found that 73% of the respondents had a negative image of Salinas de Gortari, while only 9% stated that they had a positive image of the former president.\n\nDemented World\nDemented World was a comedy CD put out by Gregg Hughes and Anthony Cumia that features bits from their Opie and Anthony radio show.

He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I. During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called \"Cihuacoatl\" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive \"Tlatoque\", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Dur\u00e1n). Dur\u00e1n also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands.\n\nZelda Fitzgerald\nZelda Fitzgerald (July 24, 1900 \u2013 March 10, 1948) was an American novelist, socialite, painter and wife of author F. Scott Fitzgerald. Born in Montgomery, Alabama, she was noted for her beauty and high spirits, and was dubbed by her husband as \"the first American Flapper\". She and Scott became emblems of the Jazz Age, for which they are still celebrated. The immediate success of Scott's first novel \"This Side of Paradise\" (1920) brought them into contact with high society, but their marriage was plagued by wild drinking, infidelity and bitter recriminations. Ernest Hemingway, whom Zelda disliked, blamed her for Scott's declining literary output, though her extensive diaries provided much material for his fiction. After being diagnosed with schizophrenia, she was increasingly confined to specialist clinics, and the couple were living apart when Scott died suddenly in 1940. Zelda died seven years later in a fire at the hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, in which she was a patient. A 1970 biography by Nancy Milford was on the short list of contenders for the Pulitzer Prize.

He played keyboards in a number of bands before finding his first commercial success with the Nice in the late 1960s. He became internationally famous for his work with the Nice, which included writing rock arrangements of classical music. After leaving the Nice in 1970, he was a founding member of Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP), one of the early progressive rock supergroups. Emerson, Lake & Palmer were commercially successful through much of the 1970s, becoming one of the best-known progressive rock groups of the era. Emerson wrote and arranged much of ELP's music on albums such as \"Tarkus\" (1971) and \"Brain Salad Surgery\" (1973), combining his own original compositions with classical or traditional pieces adapted into a rock format. Following ELP's break-up at the end of the 1970s, Emerson pursued a solo career, composed several film soundtracks, and formed the bands Emerson, Lake & Powell and 3 to carry on in the style of ELP. In the early 1990s, Emerson rejoined ELP, which reunited for two more albums and several tours before breaking up again in the late 1990s. Emerson also reunited the Nice in 2002 for a tour. During the 2000s, Emerson resumed his solo career, including touring with his own Keith Emerson Band featuring guitarist Marc Bonilla and collaborating with several orchestras. He reunited with ELP bandmate Greg Lake in 2010 for a duo tour, culminating in a one-off ELP reunion show in London to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary. Emerson's last album, \"The Three Fates Project\", with Marc Bonilla and Terje Mikkelsen, was released in 2012. Emerson reportedly suffered from depression and alcoholism, and in his later years developed nerve damage that hampered his playing, making him anxious about upcoming performances. He died by suicide on 11 March 2016 at his home in Santa Monica, California. Emerson was widely regarded as one of the top keyboard players of the progressive rock era.

He started his reign as an infant under the regency of his mother, who was in an uneasy alliance with Clothar's uncle King Guntram of Burgundy (d. 592). Clothar assumed full power over Neustria upon the death of his mother, in 597; though rich this was one of the smallest portions of Francia. He continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution in an especially brutal manner in 613, after winning the battle that enabled Chlothar to unite Francia under his rule. Like his father, he built up his territories by moving in after the deaths of other kings. His reign was long by contemporary standards, but saw the continuing erosion of royal power to the nobility and the church against a backdrop of feuding among the Merovingians. The Edict of Paris in 614, concerned with several aspects of appointments to offices and the administration of the kingdom, has been interpreted in different ways by modern historians. In 617 he made the mayor of the Palace a role held for life, an important step in the progress of this office from being first the manager of the royal household to the effective head of government, and eventually the monarch, under Pepin the Short in 751. Chlothar was forced to cede rule over Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I in 623. Unusually for a Merovingian monarch, he practised monogamy, though deaths meant that he had three wives. He was generally an ally of the church and, perhaps inspired by the example of his uncle Guntram, his reign seems to lack the outrageous acts of murder perpetrated by many of his relations, the execution of Brunhilda excepted.\n\nYuxar\u0131 Noxudlu\nYuxar\u0131 Noxudlu( also, Yukhary Nokhudlu and Verkhniye Nokhudly) is a village and municipality in the Salyan Rayon of Azerbaijan.

Comparing other English- speaking developed countries, whereas the incarceration rate of the US is 655 per 100,000 population of all ages, the incarceration rate of Canada is 114 per 100,000( as of 2015), England and Wales is 146 per 100,000( as of 2016), and Australia is 160 per 100,000( as of 2016). Comparing other developed countries, the rate of Spain is 133 per 100,000( as of 2016), Greece is 89 per 100,000( as of 2016), Norway is 73 per 100,000( as of 2016), Netherlands is 69 per 100,000( as of 2014), and Japan is 48 per 100,000( as of 2014).

It is established by Article 48( 1) of the Constitution of Mongolia. The 1992 Constitution states in Article 50( 1) that\" the Supreme Court shall be the highest judicial organ\". The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over serious criminal matters, receives appeals from lower- instance courts. It also hears appeals from the Constitutional Court with respect to the protection of the rule of law and human rights and from the Prosecutor General. The Court may also provide official interpretations of Mongolian law, except for the Constitution of Mongolia. Official interpretations are made through a special procedure referred to as a' sitting en banc'. Justices of the Supreme Court of Mongolia are appointed by the President of Mongolia after being presented by the Judicial General Council of Mongolia. The Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and 24 subordinate Justices. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President of Mongolia for a term of six years for one time. Presently, the Justices manage cases through three separate chambers: a Chamber for Criminal Cases, a Chamber for Administrative Cases and a Chamber for Civil Cases. Cases coming before each chamber are generally heard by a panel of five Justices. The Chief Justice of the Court sits as a member of the Judicial General Council of Mongolia, which is tasked with the general supervision of the judicial system.\n\nA. E. Coleby\nA. E.

It was established in 1965 and is currently edited by Marion Rust. It is the official publication of the Society of Early Americanists.\n\nGeorge Mikan\nGeorge Lawrence Mikan Jr. (June 18, 1924 \u2013 June 1, 2005), nicknamed Mr. Basketball, was an American professional basketball player for the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL) and the Minneapolis Lakers of the NBL, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Invariably playing with thick, round spectacles, the , Mikan is seen as one of the pioneers of professional basketball, redefining it as a game of so-called big men with his prolific rebounding, shot blocking, and his talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot, the result of his namesake Mikan Drill. He also utilized the underhanded free-throw shooting technique long before Rick Barry made it his signature shot. Mikan had a successful playing career, winning seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an NBA All-Star Game MVP trophy, and three scoring titles. He was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games, and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. Mikan was so dominant that he caused several rule changes in the NBA: among them, the introduction of the goaltending rule, the widening of the foul lane\u2014known as the \"Mikan Rule\"\u2014and the creation of the shot clock. After his playing career, Mikan became one of the founders of the American Basketball Association (ABA), serving as commissioner of the league. He was also vital for the forming of the Minnesota Timberwolves. In his later years, Mikan was involved in a long-standing legal battle against the NBA, fighting to increase the meager pensions for players who had retired before the league became lucrative. In 2005, Mikan died after a long battle with diabetes. For his accomplishments, Mikan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980, and was elected one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players ever in 1996. Since April 2001, a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Timberwolves' Target Center.\n\nNorth Fork Siuslaw River\nThe North Fork Siuslaw River is a tributary of the Siuslaw River in Lane County in the United States state of Oregon.

From here, the river flows about southeast, then about southwest to meet the main stem east of Florence.\n\nOrdo Ad Chao\nOrdo Ad Chao is the fourth full- length album by the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. The album received the Spellemann Award for best heavy metal album on 2 February 2008. It is the first Mayhem album with the vocalist Attila Csihar since the 1994 album\" De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" and the last with Blasphemer before he announced his departure from the band in 2008. The drummer, Jan Axel Blomberg( Hellhammer), said that the drum tracks were not equalized and only the bass drums were triggered. He ended saying\" the production sounds necro as fuck, but that's the way we wanted it \u2013 this time. It represents Mayhem today.\" Indeed, the sound of the album is much rawer than that of any official Mayhem studio release since\" Deathcrush\", with a very bass- heavy mix. Despite that, the album continues the somewhat unorthodox songwriting approach showcased on the band's last two releases, with\" Illuminate Eliminate\" being the band's second longest song. Despite being a black metal album, it has some death metal sound. The album includes some death grunts and clean vocals; however,\" Grand Declaration of War\" has cleaner vocals. It also has the distinction of being the first Mayhem album with lyrics written by Attila Csihar( the lyrics on\" De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" having been penned by Dead. Consequently, there is a thematic shift from the band's earlier lyrics, which focused mostly on morbid and Satanic ideas, and the lyrics here allude to psychic powers, the Annunaki, and the creation of the human race as a workforce for alien powers. The album was released on 23 April 2007. It charted at# 12 in Norway, making it the band's highest charting album yet. There is a version of the album supplied in a metal case that is limited to a production of 3,000.\n\nWhere did the director of film Free Lips die?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

He usually combined ballads with classical music and was deeply involved in Puerto Rican folk elements and even Andalusian music, as to produce many memorable Latino pop songs which featured elaborate, dramatic lyrics. F\u00e9lix Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Cap\u00f3 was born in Coamo, Puerto Rico to Celso Quiterio Rodr\u00edguez Rivera and Arsenia Cap\u00f3 Canevaro. He adopted \"Bobby\" as his first name and, as Rodr\u00edguez is a common Hispanic surname, he reportedly opted to use his mother's less common one, Cap\u00f3, instead. He then migrated to New York City early in the 1940s. Initially, he replaced Pedro Ortiz D\u00e1vila, \"Davilita\", in a quartet, the Cuarteto Victoria of Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn. He then joined Xavier Cugat's orchestra. Apart from singing, he was also a television host, as well as technical and musical director, and prolific songwriter. He wrote songs for many of his contemporaries. Many of these became hits in Puerto Rico, and occasionally in the rest of Latin America. One of his self-penned songs was \"El Negro Bemb\u00f3n\", a hit for Cortijo y su Combo in the mid-1950s. The song, with local circumstances and character name changed, became \"El Gitano Ant\u00f3n\", a huge hit for Catalan rumba singer Peret in Spain around the mid-1960s. Also, Bobby Capo wrote the score and songs for the movie \"MARUJA\" that was filmed at the end of the 1950s in Puerto Rico.

Cap\u00f3's composition describing his homesickness for Puerto Rico, \"So\u00f1ando con Puerto RicoDreaming of Puerto Rico\"), is revered as an anthem by Puerto Ricans residing abroad. Another of his songs, \"De Las Monta\u00f1as Venimos\" is a Christmas standard in Puerto Rico. His best-known song is \"Piel Canela\" (whose title literally translates to \"Cinnamon Skin\"). He wrote and recorded an English-language version, \"You, Too\", which he most notably recorded in Havana at the request of Rogelio Mart\u00ednez of Sonora Matancera, who asked him to sing pieces of his recently composed songs with his band. Josephine Baker recorded a version in French. The song became the main theme for a Mexican movie of the same name in the late 1950s.

The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers.

Her childhood was spent with her parents, travelling between a variety of royal residences in Britain. The intimate atmosphere of the royal court came to an end on 14 December 1861, when her father died and her mother entered a period of intense mourning. Afterwards, in the early 1860s, Helena began a flirtation with Prince Albert's German librarian, Carl Ruland. Although the nature of the relationship is largely unknown, Helena's romantic letters to Ruland survive. After the Queen found out in 1863, she dismissed Ruland, who returned to his native Germany. Three years later, on 5 July 1866, Helena married the impoverished Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple remained in Britain, in calling distance of the Queen, who liked to have her daughters nearby. Helena, along with her youngest sister, Princess Beatrice, became the Queen's unofficial secretary. However, after Queen Victoria's death on 22 January 1901, Helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings, including King Edward VII. Helena was the most active member of the royal family, carrying out an extensive programme of royal engagements. She was also an active patron of charities, and was one of the founding members of the British Red Cross. She was founding president of the Royal School of Needlework, and president of the Workhouse Infirmary Nursing Association and the Royal British Nurses' Association. As president of the latter, she was a strong supporter of nurse registration against the advice of Florence Nightingale. In 1916 she became the first member of her family to celebrate her 50th wedding anniversary, but her husband died a year later.

He co-wrote the song\" Lover Man( Oh, Where Can You Be?)\". Davis was born in Madison, Georgia. He and his family moved to Gary, Illinois, and then to Englewood, New Jersey, where he completed his high school education. Being musically gifted, he was accepted into the Juilliard School in New York to study piano and composition, his fees being paid by a benefactress. In the late 1930s or early 1940s he wrote the song\" Lover Man( Oh, Where Can You Be?)\" with Ram Ramirez but could not initially place it, until he offered it to Billie Holiday in 1942. Because of the 1942\u2013 44 musicians' strike Holiday did n't record the song until October 1944, and although at first only a minor hit it soon achieved widespread success and went on to become a jazz standard, recorded by numerous artists including Linda Ronstadt, Barbra Streisand and Petula Clark. During the early 1940s Davis struggled to make a living as a songwriter and supplemented his meagre royalties by giving piano lessons. He was drafted in 1942, but Davis, a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People( NAACP), refused to be enlisted into a segregated regiment and demanded either exemption or service in the nonsegregated Canadian army. After a series of unsuccessful representations to the authorities, which drew press coverage and the support of several public figures, he decided not to report for duty and was imprisoned. His morale and health suffered in prison, as he revealed in letters to the writer and poet Langston Hughes( with whom he would maintain a 25- year correspondence until Hughes died in 1967), and he eventually relented and joined the army. In March 1945, Davis, then an officer attached to an army musical unit, was sent to France for six months, where he registered for a course on French language and culture open to American soldiers at the University of Paris. He wrote to Hughes that Paris\" was exactly what the doctor ordered\". Upon his return to the United States at the end of 1945 he was discharged from the army and left for Hollywood, where he joined the Actors' Laboratory Theatre, taking a course on acting. He tried to pursue a career in acting but was offered only stereotypical racial roles, and at the end of 1947 he emigrated to France. Davis was warmly welcomed in Paris, partly due to the fame of the song\" Lover Man\", and was described by the influential French critic and writer Boris Vian in\" Jazz Hot\" as\" the youngest and most sympathetic of the American composers\". He began to style himself Jimmy\" Lover Man\" Davis and entered a highly creative period, writing a number of songs and placing them with major French performers, such as Yves Montand(\" J'ai de la veine\"), Maurice Chevalier(\" Trinque, trinque[ \u00c0 la tienne]\"), and Jos\u00e9phine Baker(\" You're the Greatest Love\"). His songwriting royalties were still insufficient to live on, so he began singing his own songs in solo performances, touring through France, Italy, Holland, Spain, Switzerland and other countries. In 1957 he released an album,\" Jimmy\" Loverman\" Davis Chante Jimmy\" Loverman\" Davis\", featuring songs all co-written by himself, backed by a quartet that included his friend and fellow expatriate Aaron Bridgers on piano and the French saxophonist Michel de Villers. Apart from his musical work, Davis appeared in plays, including\" Pas de week- end pour un espion\" and\" Des souris et des hommes Of Mice and Men\"), and in the films\" La Putain respectueuse\"( 1952, uncredited),\" M\u00e9lodie en sous- sol Any Number Can Win\")( 1962, as Sam), and\" Je t' aime moi non plus\"( 1976, as Mo\u00efse). Davis died in Paris in 1997. After a funeral service at the American Church in Paris, his ashes were interred in a cemetery in Auvergne.\n\nFrom Hell to Victory\nFrom Hell to Victory is a European Macaroni-War film directed in 1979 by Umberto Lenzi.

Mickey is on exhibition at a 400 m2 habitat and as of June 2009, was two years old and weighed 180 kg (400 lb). Attempts to verify this report have been bolstered by recent images purported to show the adult Mickey (see External links section). There has been no report of the birth of a healthy hybrid from a male jaguar and female tiger, which would be termed a \"jagger\".There is a claimed sighting of a lion \u00d7 black jaguar cross (male) and a tiger \u00d7 black jaguar cross (female) loose in Maui, Hawaii. There are no authenticated tiger/jaguar hybrids and the description matches that of a liger. The alleged tiger \u00d7 black jaguar was large, relatively long necked (probably due to lack of a ruff or mane) with both stripes and \"jaguar-like\" rosettes on its sides. The assertion of hybrid identity was due to the combination of black, dark brown, light brown, dark orange, dark yellow and beige markings and the tiger-like stripes radiating from its face. It is more likely to have been a released liger since these are very large and have a mix of rosettes (lion juvenile markings) and stripes and can have a brindled mix of colours exactly as described (their markings are extremely variable).\n\nHistory of Jacksonville, Florida\nIn 1513, Spanish explorers landed in Florida and claimed their discovery for Spain (see Spanish Florida). The first Europeans to visit the area were Spanish missionaries and explorers from this period. In February 1562, French naval officer Jean Ribault and a 150 settlers arrived seeking land for a safe haven for the French Huguenots, Protestants suffering religious persecution in France. Ribault explored the mouth of the St. Johns River before moving north and establishing the colony of Charlesfort on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina. Ribault returned to France for supplies, but tensions from French Wars of Religion had broken out during his absence. His return to Florida was delayed as a result. Without leadership or provisions, the colonists abandoned Charlesfort. In 1564 Ribault's former lieutenant, Ren\u00e9 Goulaine de Laudonni\u00e8re, launched a new expedition to found a colony on the St. Johns River. On June 22, 1564, the settlers established Fort Caroline atop the St. Johns Bluff.\n\nYou and the Night and the Music (Mal Waldron album)\nYou and the Night and the Music is an album by American jazz pianist Mal Waldron recorded in 1983 and released by the Japanese Paddle Wheel label.\n\nRoss Reynolds (rugby union)\nRoss John Reynolds( born 27 September 1958 in Orange) is a former Australian rugby union player, coach and businessman.\n\nSimone Bianchi (athlete)\nSimone Bianchi( born 27 January 1973) is a retired Italian long jumper.\n\nWhich film has the director who died later, Akhono Onek Raat or Bitter Rice?"}], "max_tokens": 60}}

The term\" hip hop studies\" began circulating in the mid-2000s, and though it is not clear who first coined the term to label the field, the field of hip hop studies is oft cited as having been crystallized by the publication of\" That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader\" in 2003. \" That's the Joint!\" includes approximately 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism. The publication of this anthology was unprecedented, and highlights the evolving and continuous influence of\" one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s.\" The publication of the first edition of\" That's the Joint!\" marked a consolidating moment for the field of hip hop studies because it brought together key writings on hip hop from a diversity of hip hop authorities. Hip hop culture, rooted in the 1970s post -industrial South Bronx, is polyvocal and is represented in five cultural modes: rap music( oral), turntablism or\" DJing\"( aural), breaking( physical), graffiti art( visual), and knowledge( mental). Hip hop has, and continues to produce a remarkable array of thinkers who embody complex ideological makeups exemplified through their performances as writers, artists, poets, and scholars. In\" Hip Hop Matters\"( 2005), professor and media scholar S. Craig Watkins labels the increasing interdisciplinary cohort of hip hop academics and scholars as the\" hip- hop intelligentsia,\" and suggests that while this group of individuals may not often been discussed as an entity in and of itself, their existence is, without question, one of the greatest achievements of the hip hop movement. Watkins writes:\" The growing array of hip- hop intellectuals is a spectacular indication of the movement's multifaceted demeanor and ceaseless energy ... What has emerged is a body of thinkers who articulate a wide range of ideas that, in their unique way, map out the contradictory currents, ideas, and worldview that percolate throughout the phenomenal world of hip hop. From spoken- word artists to academic scholars hip- hop intellectuals are translating the movement into a vast mix of critical commentary and artistic expression. The results both energize and expand the image and imagination of the hip- hop intelligentsia.\" Hip hop studies is part of the larger hip hop movement. The research and teaching in this interdisciplinary field includes analyses of technology, pop culture, linguistics, globalization, geography, race, electoral politics, and a variety of aspects related to contemporary culture, as scholars attempt to critically assess hip hop as a movement. Scholarship in hip hop studies is rooted in the foundational, Afro-diasporic call- and- response mechanism within hip hop culture.\n\nHenry II, Margrave of Meissen\nHenry II( 1103 \u2013 1123) was the Margrave of Meissen and the Saxon Ostmark( as\" Lusizensis marchio\": margrave of Lusatia) from his birth until his death.

He was the second Meissener margrave of the House of Wettin. He was initially under the regency of his great uncle Thimo. He died young and without children in 1123.

The Japanese Military Administration, which at that time occupied Malaya, proclaimed Sultan Ali as the Sultan of Terengganu. On 18 October 1943, the Thai government under Prime Minister Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram took over the administration of Terengganu from the Japanese and continued to recognise Sultan Ali as the legitimate Sultan. When the British returned after the end of World War II, they declined to recognise Sultan Ali. Allegedly, Sultan Ali was too much in debt and had been too close to the Japanese during their occupation. According to Sultan Ali, the British Military Administration wanted him removed for his refusal to sign the Malayan Union treaty. The British Military Administration also disapproved of Sultan Ali's character, where he was said to have repudiated his official consort Tengku Putri Hajjah \u2018 Ain ul- Jamal,\" Tengku Sri Nila Utama\" of Pahang( the daughter of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang) and had contracted an unsuitable second marriage to a former prostitute. On 5 November 1945 the Terengganu State Council of thirteen members announced the dismissal of Sultan Ali and the appointment of Tengku Ismail as the sixteenth Sultan of Terengganu. Tengku Ismail became known as Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah and was installed on 6 June 1949 at Istana Maziah, Kuala Terengganu. Sultan Ismail's descendants have since ruled Terengganu.

Raised in Utah in a respected, if impoverished, Latter-day Saint (LDS Church) family, Fawn McKay drifted away from Mormonism during her years of graduate work at the University of Chicago. She married Bernard Brodie, an ethnically Jewish academic who became a national defense expert; they had three children. Although Fawn Brodie eventually became one of the first tenured female professors of history at UCLA, she is best known for her five biographies, four of which incorporate insights from Freudian psychology. Brodie's depiction of Joseph Smith in 1945 as a fraudulent \"genius of improvisation\" has been described as both a \"beautifully written biography ... the work of a mature scholar [that] represented the first genuine effort to come to grips with the contradictory evidence about Smith's early life\" and as a work that presented conjecture as fact. Her best-selling psychobiography of Thomas Jefferson, published in 1974, was the first serious study to examine evidence related to accounts that he had taken his slave Sally Hemings as a concubine. Brodie concluded these accounts were true, a conclusion supported by a 1998 DNA analysis and current scholarly consensus.\n\nSaint Helena\nUnemployment levels are low (31 individuals in 2013, compared to 50 in 2004 and 342 in 1998).

White\nEllen Gould White (n\u00e9e Ellen Gould Harmon; November 26, 1827 \u2013 July 16, 1915) was an author and an American Christian pioneer. Along with other Adventist leaders such as Joseph Bates and her husband James White, she was instrumental within a small group of early Adventists who formed what became known as the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The \"Smithsonian\" magazine named Ellen G. White among the \"100 Most Significant Americans of All Time. White claimed to have received over 2,000 visions and dreams from God in public and private meetings throughout her life, which were witnessed by Adventist pioneers and the general public. She verbally described and published for public consumption the content of the alleged visions. The Adventist pioneers viewed these experiences as the Biblical gift of prophecy as outlined in and which describe the testimony of Jesus as the \"spirit of prophecy.\" Her \"Conflict of the Ages\" series of writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in Biblical history and in church history. This cosmic conflict, referred to by Seventh-day Adventist theologians as the \"Great Controversy theme,\" became foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Her book on successful Christian living, \"Steps to Christ\", has been published in more than 140 languages. The book Child Guidance, a compilation of her writings about child care, training and education, has been used as the foundation for the Seventh-day Adventist school system. White was considered a controversial figure by her critics, with much of the controversy centering on her reports of visionary experiences and on the use of other sources in her writings. Historian Randall Balmer has described White as \"one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion\". Walter Martin described her as \"one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the horizon of religious history\". Arthur L. White, her grandson and biographer, writes that Ellen G. White is the most translated female non-fiction author in the history of literature, as well as the most translated American non-fiction author of either gender.
