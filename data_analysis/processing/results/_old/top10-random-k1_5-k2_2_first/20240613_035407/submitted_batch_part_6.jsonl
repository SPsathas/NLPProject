According to the \"Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn\", he took the throne after overthrowing and killing the previous incumbent, Adamair, and ruled for eleven years, until he was killed in battle by Fergus Fortamail. The \"Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn\" synchronises his reign with that of Ptolemy V Epiphanes in Egypt (204\u2013181 BC). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's \"Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn\" dates his reign to 285\u2013274 BC, that of the \"Annals of the Four Masters\" (which gives him a reign of seventeen years) to 414\u2013396 BC.\n\nEochaid mac \u00c1eda Find\nEochaid mac \u00c1eda Find is a spurious King of D\u00e1l Riata found in some rare High Medieval king-lists and in older history books. Supposedly a son of \u00c1ed Find (died 778) and successor to \u00c1ed's brother Fergus mac Echdach, Eochaid is now thought to represent a misplacing of the reign of Eochaid mac Echdach. The reigns of Selbach mac Ferchair, D\u00fangal mac Selbaig and, perhaps, Alp\u00edn mac Echdach, are similarly misplaced in the sources which contain this Eochaid.\n\nAirechtach ua Dunchadh Muirsce\nAirechtach ua Dunchadh Muirsce( ???\u2013730) was a king of Ui Fiachrach Muaidhe.

According to legend, he was a High King of Ireland, and died after being struck by lightning while on an expedition to the Alps.\n\nEochu Buadach\nEochu Buadach, son of Dui Ladrach, was, according to some redactions or versions of Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, a High King of Ireland. But he is not included as a High King in other versions of the story. He was the father of two High Kings of Ireland, Ugaine Mor, and Bodbchad.\n\nList of Florida hurricanes\nThe List of Florida hurricanes encompasses approximately 500 tropical or subtropical cyclones that affected the state of Florida. More storms hit Florida than any other U.S. state, and since 1851 only eighteen hurricane seasons passed without a known storm impacting the state. Collectively, cyclones that hit the region have resulted in over 10,000 deaths, most of which occurring prior to the start of Hurricane Hunters flights in 1943.

This film was also the second onscreen adaptation of the 1917 musical \"The Better 'Ole\" by Bruce Bairnsfather and Arthur Elliot. Charlie Chaplin's eldest brother Sydney Chaplin played the main lead as Old Bill in perhaps his best-known film today.

From 1872 Brunner devoted himself especially to studying the early laws and institutions of the Franks and kindred peoples of Western Europe, and on these subjects his researches have been of supreme value. He also became a leading authority on modern German law. He became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1884, and in 1887, after the death of Georg Waitz, undertook the supervision of the \"Leges\" section of the \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica\", which he led until his death in 1915. This was the first time that a legal scholar led a section of the MGH; Brunner oversaw an extensive overhaul of the section's program (the re-editing of the \"Capitularia\" and the \"Lex Alamannorum\", then the \"Lex Burgundionum\", and finally the \"Lex Baiuvariorum\").\n\nThe Irresistible Man\nThe Irresistible Man  is a 1937 German romantic comedy film directed by G\u00e9za von Bolv\u00e1ry and starring Anny Ondra, Hans S\u00f6hnker and Trude Hesterberg.

While his own tomb has not been located, it was likely located in the area of Dra' Abu el-Naga' where the pyramid tomb of his brother Nubkheperre Intef was found in 2001. The pyramidion of the pyramid of Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef's pyramid was found in Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It has a slope of 60 degrees and is inscribed with this king's names. The pyramidion is now in the British Museum (BM EA 478).\n\nKekheretnebti\nKekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30\u201335 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu.

On a relief found at Saqqara she is called\" his beloved daughter\" and\" king's daughter\". Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the\" noble woman\" Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.\n\nAnkhesenpaaten Tasherit\nAnkhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit are two small princesses who appear in scenes dating to the later part of the reign of Akhenaten.

He founded the Grey Abbey in Kildare, Ireland for the Franciscans in 1260. During the Second Barons' War campaign of 1265, William held Gloucester Castle against Prince Edward. He was pardoned afterwards and entered the service of King Henry III of England. He served against the Welsh in 1277 and later in 1282.

William lost his position as Lord Justice. William attempted to sue FitzThomas for defamation before the council at Dublin.

Her mother's name is not recorded. She had at least one brother and at least one sister, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d (died circa 1002). \u00c6lffl\u00e6d was married to Byrhtnoth, who probably succeeded her father as ealdorman of Essex. Byrhtnoth was killed at the Battle of Maldon in 991. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and \u00c6lffl\u00e6d were \u00c6lfgar's heirs at his death, some time between 946 and 951 based on the dating of his will, S1483. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d married Edmund in 944 following the death of his first wife \u00c6lfgifu, mother of the future kings Eadwig and Edgar.

Schure founded the New York Institute of Technology( NYIT) in 1955. He also served as the Chancellor of Nova Southeastern University( NSU) from 1970 until 1985. Schure is credited with saving Nova University, which was in deep financial trouble, after he became the school's chancellor in 1970. The university is now called Nova Southeastern University, and is now the largest private university in Florida, with more than 28,000 students as of 2009. Schure and then- Nova University President Abraham Fischler, Ed.D., formed a federation between Nova and the New York Institute of Technology. The partnership between the two institutions brought money and new programs to Nova University. The money from NYIT allowed Nova University to remain open during its financial difficulties. The alliance between NYIT and Nova University ended in 1985. In November 1974 Schure hired recent University of Utah doctoral graduate Edwin Catmull to direct NYIT's fledgling computer graphics lab, and ensured that the lab received special funding for more than 5 years. Schure was an early champion of computer animation; in 1979 Catmull left to form a computer- graphics group with Lucasfilm and the core technical team- including computer animation pioneers Alvy Ray Smith, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim, Jim Blinn, and Jim Clark- came from the NYIT lab. ( In 1986, that computer- graphics group would be funded by recently fired Steve Jobs as the independent company Pixar which manufactured and sold image- processing computers using the concepts first developed at NYIT, and also produced projects using them.) Although Clark would move on to found Silicon Graphics and Netscape, the rest of the NYIT team continued to play key roles as Pixar's animation developed from its first short films in the mid-1980s onward. It can be said that Dr. Schure's vision and support from 1975 to 1980, and the low- pressure academic research lab environment at NYIT, was an essential contributor to the development of many of the technical innovations needed to produce realistic computer generated films. He funded the computers and frame buffers used in the making of the unfinished computer- generated film\" The Works( film)\". It was also during this time that Schure directed the animated movie Tubby the Tuba( 1975 film). Alexander Schure died from complications of Alzheimer's Disease on Long Island on October 29, 2009, at the age of 89. He was survived by his second wife, Gail; and four children- Dr. Barbara Schure Weinschel, Dr. Matthew Schure, Dr. Jonathan Schure, and Mr. Louis Schure. Following his death, former NSU president Fischler said Schure\" was a brilliant individual with a very creative mind. He was an excellent friend to me and the university.

Although they were considered lesser than free men, the slaves under the code were allowed to choose whomever they wanted to marry, buy property, open businesses, and purchase their freedom.
