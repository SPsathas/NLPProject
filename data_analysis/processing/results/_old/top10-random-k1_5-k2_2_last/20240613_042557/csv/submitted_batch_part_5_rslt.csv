Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow: An eccentric pirate characterized by his slightly drunken swagger, slurred speech and awkwardly flailing hand gestures. He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name ""Jack Sparrow""; however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, ""a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate."" At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards. Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, ""He's ruining the film!"" Depp answered back, ""Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot.""

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales
Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow: Rønning wanted to focus on relatable characters, as in the first film, ``where Jack is not the (lead... but) comes in and crashes the party every now and then, ''and to make use of Depp's`` comedic genius''. The film examines Jack's backstory, with the young Jack portrayed by Anthony De La Torre, whose face was replaced by a CGI replica of Depp as he looked in 21 Jump Street and What's Eating Gilbert Grape. Rønning felt de-aging Depp was tricky against the canon of the franchise.

Emperor Ruizong of Tang (22 June 662 – 13 July 716), personal name Li Dan, also known at times during his life as Li Xulun, Li Lun, Wu Lun, and Wu Dan, was the fifth and ninth emperor of Tang Dynasty. He was the eighth son of Emperor Gaozong and the fourth son of Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (During the first period, he did not rule the, and the entire government In the hands of to his mother, Empress Wu, later as Wu Zetian Is known Was). In February 684, Li Dan's mother Empress Wu demoted his older brother Emperor Zhongzong (Li Xian) who had attempted to rule free of his mother, and named him emperor (as Emperor Ruizong). Emperor Ruizong, however, was a puppet under control of his mother and did not have any real power. In October 690 he ceded the imperial throne to his mother, who installed herself as empress regnant – the only woman in Chinese history ever to rule as empress regnant. Emperor Ruizong was reduced to the position of crown prince, with the unconventional title of ""Huangsi"" (皇嗣, ""imperial successor""). In the following years, Empress Wu's nephews Wu Chengsi and Wu Sansi tried to have one of them named heir to the throne, but Wu Zetian resisted these calls. Eventually, in October 698, faced with foreign invasion and dissatisfaction at home, Empress Wu accepted the suggestion of the chancellor Di Renjie and recalled the exiled Li Xian to the capital Luoyang. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the position of crown prince to his elder brother, and Li Xian became crown prince instead. In 705, a coup overthrew Wu Zetian and restored Emperor Zhongzong to the throne. The five years of Emperor Zhongzong's reign were dominated by Zhongzong's empress consort, Empress Wei. In the beginning of July 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei who then named Zhongzong's youngest son Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen emperor (as Emperor Shang). A mere two weeks later, Li Dan's sister Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi launched a coup which resulted in the death of Empress Wei. Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song then persuaded Li Dan to take the throne himself, and he agreed, returning to the throne in Emperor Shang's stead. Li Longji, although not the oldest son, was made crown prince on account of his accomplishments. Soon, however, tensions between Princess Taiping, who had many supporters, and Li Longji mounted. Eventually, in September 712, Emperor Ruizong, believing that astrological signs called for a change of emperors, abdicated in favor of Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong, now carrying the title of ""Taishang Huang"" (retired emperor), continued to wield actual power. However, in 713, suspecting Princess Taiping of planning a coup, Emperor Xuanzong acted first, killing her associates and forcing her to commit suicide. After the death of Princess Taiping, Emperor Ruizong himself yielded imperial powers to Emperor Xuanzong and left the governmental scene. He died in 716.

Gilduin of Le Puiset
Gilduin of Le Puiset( d. between 1130 and 1135) was the son of Hugh I of Le Puiset and Alice of Monthléry, daughter of Guy I of Montlhéry. Monk at St. Martin- des- Champs, prior at Cluny Abbey, prior at Lurey- le- Bourg, abbot of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat. It is unclear when Gilduin became abbot of St. Mary, but he was in this position when his cousin Baldwin II confirmed the privileges of the abbey, the chief Marian shrine in Jerusalem, on 31 January 1120. In that same year, Gilduin and Baldwin II travelled to Edessa, joining with Gilduin ’s brother Waleran. There they met Hugh, Archbishop of Edessa. Hugh, in possession of two sacred relics — a finger of St. Stephen and a tooth of John the Baptist- was concerned about keeping the relics in a place that could be overrun by Moslems. He gave the relics to Gilduin for transfer to Cluny, now under Pons of Melgueil, a mission which he completed. Gilduin may have been associated with Barisan the Old. "" Les Lignages d’ Outremer"" identified Balian[ Barisan] as the brother of a Count Guilduin of Chartres. Riley- Smith speculates that Barisan may have been the illegitimate brother or brother- in- law of Gilduin, but there is little evidence to support this. It is not known who succeeded Gilduin as abbot of St. Mary.

The war ended with the intervention of the Archbishop's uncle, Amédée V of Savoie, who reluctantly agreed with the king's side not to be the next victim. A treaty was signed on 10 April 1312. But Peter losses control of Lyon to the King. The people of Lyon receive several franchises, such as the right to establish fees for the service of the city. These are the subject of two written papers, one by clerics Lyon between the opening of the Council of Vienna on 16 October 1311 and the Treaty of 10 April 1312, appointed Grauamina, the other by the prosecutor of the bailiff Macon, between this treaty and the end of 1312.

Of this, the royal treasury will not give in that 2000 livres, which the king added, by ""royal munificence"" (sua munificentia regalis) 500 Other livres. These compensations are paid to the archbishop 27 December 1312. In 1316, he sees the election and coronation of Pope John XXII in his city.

Neith (wife of Pepi II)
Neith was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, one of the principal queens of the Old Kingdom pharaoh Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled (c. 2278 BC – c. 2184 BC). Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.

Ankhesenpepi IV
Ankhesenpepi IV was an ancient Egyptian queen, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi II of the Sixth dynasty. She was the mother of King Neferkare II. Pepi II also had several other wives.

Iput II
Iput was an ancient Egyptian queen consort of the Sixth dynasty, a sister and wife of Pepi II.

Ankhesenpepi II
Ankhesenpepi II or Ankhesenmeryre II was a queen consort during the sixth dynasty of Egypt. She was the wife of Kings Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, and the mother of Pepi II. She was buried in a pyramid in Saqqara.

Pepi II Neferkare
Pepi II (also Pepy II; 2284 BC – after 2247 BC, probably either 2216 or 2184 BC) was a pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt's Old Kingdom who reigned from 2278 BC. His throne name, Neferkare (""Nefer-ka-Re""), means ""Beautiful is the Ka of Re"". He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks—the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II—were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: ""King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II"". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.

Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark
Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark and Norway (7 July 1771 – 13 January 1843) was the daughter of the Queen of Denmark, Caroline Matilda of Great Britain. Though officially regarded as the daughter of King Christian VII, it is widely accepted that her biological father was Johann Friedrich Struensee, the king’s royal physician and ""de facto"" regent of the country at the time of her birth.

Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia
Thacholf, Thachulf, Thaculf, or Thakulf (died 1 August 873) was the Duke of Thuringia from 849 until his death. He held the titles of ""comes"" (count) and ""dux"" (duke) and he ruled over a ""marca"" (march). He may have been the son of Hadulf, son of Thankulf. Thachulf was placed in charge of the Sorbian March in 849 with the title of ""dux Sorabici limitis"", giving him military command over the counts with lands bordering the Sorbs. On account of his knowledge of Slavic customs, he was petitioned by the Sorbs with the offer of hostages for peace to protect them from the warmaking of Ernest, Duke of Bavaria, but he had been wounded in battle the day before the arrival of the Slav embassy and so could not be of assistance. Hiding his injury from the Slav delegates, he sent men to the other leaders of the Frankish host proposing terms with the Slavs, but the other generals suspected him of a ""coup"" to assume supreme command of the army and so ignored his representatives and made war anyway, being badly defeated in the process. According to the ""Annales Fuldenses"", in 858, a Reichstag held at Frankfurt under Louis the German sent three armies to the eastern frontiers to reinforce the submission of the Slavic tribes. Carloman was sent against Great Moravia, Louis the Younger against the Obodrites and Linonen, and Thachulf against the Sorbs, who were refusing to obey him. The armies of Carloman and Louis set out in July, but it is uncertain if Thachulf ever undertook a campaign, as the Sorbs rose in rebellion late in that year and do not appear to have been restless beforehand. The ""Annales Fuldenses"" may be incorrect about the timing of Thachulf's command to send an army against them. Thachulf died in the summer of 873. His death was immediately followed by the revolt of the Sorbs, Siusli, and their neighbours. The revolt was not put down until Liutbert and Radulf, Thachulf's successor, campaigned in January 874.

Johann Ludwig Knoop (15 May 1821 in Bremen - 14 August 1894 in Bremen) was a cotton merchant and entrepreneur from the city-state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, who became one of the richest entrepreneurs in his time. He was created a Baron by Alexander II of Russia. He studied in Bremen, and learned the cotton business at Manchester with the Bremen-born cotton exporter Johan Frerichs's company De Jersey & Co. He went to Moscow as assistant to the firm's agent Franz Holzhauer in 1840. That year he established the first power-driven cotton mill in Russia. In 1842, the British ban on the export of cotton machinery, imposed in 1775 to protect the country's head start in technology, was lifted, allowing the manufacture of cotton to expand in Russia. Knoop used English credit to build and fit out mills with English equipment. The commissioning in 1847 of Morozov's Nikolsk mill at Orekhovo-Zuyevo, Knoop's sixth, was seen as a landmark in the industry's development in Russia. In 1852, he founded L Knoop & Co, in association with De Jersey and the machinery manufacturer Platt Brothers of Oldham, Lancashire. In 1857, he built the largest cotton spinning mill in Europe on the island of Kreenholm at Narva, Estonia, which employed 4500 people. The Krenholm Manufacturing Company's factory in Narva had nearly half a million spindles driven by water-power. It paid low wages, but took its responsibilities to its workforce seriously, introducing a health insurance scheme and supplying workers with dwellings, kindergartens, and schools. Eventually, he was responsible for equipping 187 cotton mills on Russian territory. However, Knoop came under attack from the Russian Technical Society for retarding industrial development in the country. This was because he relied exclusively on English machinery and also supplied the factories with English managers, technicians, and supervisors. He was created a baron by Tsar Alexander II in 1877. He died on 16 August 1894 at St Magnus, Bremen, where a city park created from his estate is named after him. His descendants include Ernst Albrecht, Hans-Holger Albrecht and Ursula von der Leyen.

Lion
Lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, either as a device on shields or as supporters, but the lioness is used much less frequently. The formal language of heraldry, called blazon, employs French terms to describe the images precisely. Such descriptions specify whether lions or other creatures are ""rampant"" (rearing) or ""passant"" (crouching).Lions continue to appear in modern literature as characters including the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, and the comedic Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Lion symbolism was used from the advent of cinema; one of the most iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of the Kenyan lioness Elsa in the movie Born Free, which is based on the factual book of the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King, the 2005 DreamWorks animated character Alex in Madagascar, and the 2006 Disney animated character Samson in The Wild.

Belostok, Tomsk Oblast
Belostok is a small village in Russia located northwest of Tomsk, Russia. It was voluntarily founded, at the turn of the 20th century, by Polish settlers from the Podlaskie/ Białystok region. Today, Bielastok has several dozen wooden and brick houses, a few shops, a community centre and a Roman Catholic church built in the early 20th century. In the beginning Polish settlers were doing fairly well and the village developed quickly, but the situation changed when the new authority came to power. At the time of the Soviet rule the residents of Bielastok resisted compulsory collectivisation for a long time, refused to join the kolkhoz, fought for the right to keep their identity and religion. Between 1936– 1938, Poles were affected by mass repressions on the part of the NKVD: attempts were made to ban the use of the Polish language at school, orders undermining everyday life were sent, severe punishments were imposed, and matters of faith and tradition were interfered into. Finally, the residents of Bielastok gave in, and the village was collectivized. Soon afterwards the Polish operation of the NKVD arrested more than one hundred men from Bielastok. The accused were subjected to sham trials, sentenced to death and murdered in the nearby Krivosheino. Afterward their bodies were thrown into the Ob River without informing their families about their fate of their grandparents, parents, and sons killed. The truth about the NKVD crime was published only in 1993 by Vasily Khanevich, the researcher of the history of Poles in the Tomsk Oblast, who came from Bielastok and published the book Białostocka tragedia[ The Bielastok Tragedy] based on archival documents and eyewitness accounts.

Sixties Scoop
The term Sixties Scoop refers to the practice, during the 1960s, of taking (``scooping up '') children of Aboriginal peoples in Canada from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption. Provincially, each region had their specific adoption or fostering program and policy. For example, Saskatchewan had the Adopt Indian Metis (AIM) Program. The children were typically placed for adoption or fostering in Canada though a few were placed in the United States or western Europe. The term`` Sixties scoop'' was coined by Patrick Johnston in his 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. It is a variation of the broader term Baby Scoop Era to refer to the period from the late 1950s to 1980s when large numbers of children were taken from their parents for adoption. However and henceforth, the continued practice of taking Indigenous, Inuit and Metis children from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption is termed Millennium Scoop

John Brown (footballer, born 1915)
John Bell Brown (21 February 1915 – 30 August 2005) was a Scottish footballer, who played as a goalkeeper. At club level he played for Clyde, Hamilton, Hibernian, Dundee and Kilmarnock, helping Clyde win the Scottish Cup in 1939. He also played once for the Scotland national football team, in a 1939 British Home Championship match against Wales. Brown's football career was clearly interrupted by the Second World War, as his two greatest achievements, winning a Scotland cap and the Scottish Cup, came during the last season completed before the war. Brown only conceded one goal in the whole competition en route to winning the Scottish Cup, a penalty kick in a 4–1 win against Rangers. He later complained that he would not have conceded even that solitary goal if Rangers had used their regular penalty taker, Bob McPhail, because Brown knew where McPhail normally placed his penalties. A transfer to Arsenal was proposed, but did not materialise due to the outbreak of war in September 1939. During the war he entered the service of the Royal Navy, while making guest appearances for Hamilton. He transferred to Hibernian in 1942, but played for Gillingham of England's Kent League between 1944 and 1946. Upon returning to Hibernian, he helped them win the Scottish league championship in 1947–48. Brown then had spells with Dundee and Kilmarnock before retiring as a player in 1950. He then became a physiotherapist, working for Kilmarnock, the All Blacks and the Scotland national rugby union team. Brown was the first person to serve in that function for the Scotland rugby side. Brown was part of a sizeable sporting family. His sons Peter and Gordon (""Broon frae Troon"") both played for Scotland at rugby union, while two of his brothers, Tom and Jim, also played professional football. Jim was selected by the United States for the 1930 FIFA World Cup. Brown himself was also a talented player of both badminton and golf, playing off a scratch handicap.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 6)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 30 BC – 33 AD) was a Roman senator, politician and general, praised by the historian Tacitus.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger or Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor( died 30 BC), was the only child of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and his wife Junia Secunda, a half- sister to Brutus the Younger, one of Julius Caesar's assassins.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, (6–39) was the son of consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. He and his sister Aemilia Lepida were both married to siblings of the Emperor Caligula (Aemilia married Caligula's elder brother Drusus Caesar; Lepidus married to Caligula's younger sister Julia Drusilla). He was also great-grandson of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul of 50 BC and brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Some areas of his lineage are unclear. However, through his mother Julia the Younger, Lepidus was the great grandson of Emperor Augustus Caesar. Lepidus married Caligula's sister Drusilla sometime in November or December of 37. Little is known about him prior to this. Drusilla had been married to Lucius Cassius Longinus since 33 but Caligula forced his brother-in-law to divorce Drusilla so that she could marry Lepidus. The marriage lasted until Drusilla's death in June 38. They had no children. Because of this marriage, Lepidus had become a close friend to Caligula and his family. After the death of Gemellus in 37, Lepidus was publicly marked by Caligula as his heir. In late 38, when the governor of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus was arrested, Lepidus successfully persuaded Caligula to exile Flaccus to Andros rather than Gyarus. Sometime in 39, however, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla that detailed an adulterous affair with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor. Lepidus was executed and Caligula's sisters were exiled. Agrippina was given the bones of Lepidus in an urn, and she carried them to Rome. Caligula sent three daggers to the Temple of Mars the Avenger to celebrate the death. In the Senate, Vespasian made a motion that the remains of Lepidus be thrown away instead of buried. The motion was carried and Lepidus was not given a proper burial.

Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus
Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (flourished 1st century BC) was the brother of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and son to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the consul of 78 BC. His mother may have been a daughter of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (78 BC)
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( 120 BC – 77 BC) was a Roman statesman and general. After the death of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, he attempted to undermine the Sullan constitution and revive the"" populares"" faction. This brought him into conflict with the optimates whom Sulla had put back in power. In 77 BC, when he was recalled from his proconsulship of Gaul, he returned to Rome at the head of an army and an armed conflict erupted. Lepidus' forces were defeated in a battle near the Milvian Bridge and as a result his rebellion failed. He was the father of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and of one of the consuls for 50 BC Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus.

Steam power during the Industrial Revolution
The first safe and successful steam power plant was introduced by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Newcomen apprently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide - ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged to come to an arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent. Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on Papin's experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into the lower half of the cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity - induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity - actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power stroke raised the pump, priming it and preparing the pumping stroke. At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical plug tree suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self - acting.

His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.

Oscar II of Sweden
Oscar II (Oscar Fredrik; 21 January 1829 – 8 December 1907) was the King of Sweden from 1872 until his death, and was also the final King of Norway from the House of Bernadotte. Oscar II was King during a time when both Sweden and Norway were undergoing a period of industrialization and rapid technological progress. His reign also saw the gradual decline of the Union of Sweden and Norway, which culminated in its dissolution in 1905. He was subsequently succeeded as King of Norway by his grandnephew Prince Carl of Denmark under the regnal name Haakon VII, and as King of Sweden by his eldest son, Gustaf V.
Oscar II is the paternal great-great-grandfather of Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden since 1973. Harald V, King of Norway since 1991, is a great-grandson of Oscar II, through his third son Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland.

Umayyad Caliphate
The Umayyads have met with a largely negative reception from later Islamic historians, who have accused them of promoting a kingship (mulk, a term with connotations of tyranny) instead of a true caliphate (khilafa). In this respect it is notable that the Umayyad caliphs referred to themselves not as khalifat rasul Allah (""successor of the messenger of God"", the title preferred by the tradition), but rather as khalifat Allah (""deputy of God""). The distinction seems to indicate that the Umayyads ""regarded themselves as God's representatives at the head of the community and saw no need to share their religious power with, or delegate it to, the emergent class of religious scholars."" In fact, it was precisely this class of scholars, based largely in Iraq, that was responsible for collecting and recording the traditions that form the primary source material for the history of the Umayyad period. In reconstructing this history, therefore, it is necessary to rely mainly on sources, such as the histories of Tabari and Baladhuri, that were written in the Abbasid court at Baghdad.

Iggy Pop
James Newell Osterberg Jr. (born April 21, 1947), better known as Iggy Pop, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor. Designated the ""Godfather of Punk"", he was the vocalist of influential proto-punk band the Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited multiple times since. Initially playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll, the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by Pop. He had a long collaborative and personal friendship with David Bowie over the course of his career, beginning with the Stooges' album ""Raw Power"" in 1973. With both musicians having relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions, Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums ""The Idiot"" and ""Lust for Life"". Throughout his career, Pop is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics and distinctive voice. He was one of the first performers to do a stage-dive and popularized the activity. Pop, who traditionally (but not exclusively) performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd. Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including garage rock, punk rock, hard rock, art rock, new wave, jazz, blues, and electronic.

Malek Jehan Khanum was a Persian princess of the Qajar dynasty by both birth and marriage. By birth, being the daughter of Amir Mohammad Qassem Khan Qajar Qovanlou' Amir Kabir' and Princess Begom Jan Khanoum Qajar, she was the granddaughter of Fath- Ali Shah Qajar of Persia. Her paternal grandfather was the powerful Qajar commander Amir Soleyman Khan Qajar Qovanlou' Amir Kabir'' Nezam od- Doleh'' Etezad od- Doleh' and her paternal grandmother was a princess of the Zand dynasty. She was married at a young age to her cousin, Mohammad Shah Qajar of Persia( reign 1834 – 1848). Her husband married about fifteen women during his lifetime, but she was one of his earliest wives. She held prestige within the harem for several reasons: because of her seniority among the Shah's wives; because she was a member of the family by birth and therefore well- networked and well- versed in their ways; because she bore her husband as many as five children( two of whom reached adulthood) and most of all because she was the mother of the crown prince. Her only surviving son, Naser al- Din Shah Qajar, would succeed his father to the throne of Persia. Her title Mehd- i-aulia or Mehd- e-olia means"" Sublime Cradle"" and this title was generally bestowed on the mother of the heir apparent. As empress dowager, she was the regent of Persian Empire for one month, from 5 September until 5 October in 1848, between the death of her husband and the accession to the throne of her son. As queen mother, she exerted considerable political influence during the reign of her son from 1848 until her death in 1873. She is described as a strong personality and politically gifted. Strongly rooted in family and clan networks, she tended to favour and support the Qajar nobility rather than merited commoners, mostly because members of the Qajar family and clan had much better access to her as compared to outsiders.
