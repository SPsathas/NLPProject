With the death of his mother, Gertrud, he began ferreting out details of the Nazi occupation of Latvia, discovering by chance his biological mother ’s name, Edith Radtke, and his own birth certificate in a prison hospital. Edith was murdered in a madhouse by Nazi doctors during the war. My rebellious mother is definitely a part of me, I was lucky enough to put my craziness into my films, the director commented in a later interview.  Two Mothers was a hit in German television. It was very well received, even but usual critics of Praunheim's work.  They seemed to love this one, the director explained, because they can identify with its narrative. It is my most emotional film. I made it without realizing that I was really in the film.

4,"Ronnie Rocket is an unfinished film project written by David Lynch, who also intended to direct it. Begun after the success of Lynch's 1977 film EraserheadRonnie Rocket was shelved after Lynch felt he would be unable to find financial backing for the project. He instead sought out an existing script on which to base his next film, settling on what would become 1980's The Elephant Man.

The script featured a three- foot tall man with control over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J. Anderson when tentatively casting for this role, and later cast him in Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive as a result.

The script was co-written by Lenny Bruce and Jack Henley from a story by George W. George and George F. Slavin.

Charles Armand René de La Trémoille (14 January 1708, in Paris – 23 May 1741), 6th duc de Thouars, was the son of Charles Louis Bretagne de La Trémoille and his wife, Marie Madeleine Motier de la Fayette. La Trémoille was a French soldier and president of the States of Brittany. He joined the military at a young age and became a colonel of the Champagne regiment at the age of eighteen.

6,"tefan I. Neniescu (October 8, 1897–October 1979) was a Romanian poet and aesthetician. Born in Bucharest, his parents were the poet Ioan S. Neniescu and his wife Elena (née tefan). He attended Sapienza University of Rome from 1920, as well as the literature and philosophy department of Bucharest University. At first an assistant professor of aesthetics, he later became an associate professor at Bucharest. He served as press secretary and later economic adviser to the Romanian legation in The Hague. Neniescu's first publication was a 1915 article about William Shakespeare that appeared in Noua revist român. His first book of poetry, Denii (1919), was followed by Vraj (1923) and Ode italice (1925). His single volume of theatre was Trei mistere (1922). From 1924, he wrote for Gândirea, and was a founding member of Romania's PEN Club. He also contributed poetry and art criticism to Convorbiri LiterareIdeea europeanVremeaUniversul literarViaa RomâneascAdevrul and Arta plastic. In 1925, Neniescu published a treatise, Istoria artei ca filosofie a istoriei. He translated from Benedetto Croce (Aesthetic, 1922) and Niccolò Machiavelli (The Mandrake, 1926). Initially, Neniescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the Gândirist current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume Ani (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature.

Ioan S. Neniescu (April 11, 1854–February 23, 1901) was a Romanian poet and playwright. Born in Galai, his parents were tefan Vasiliu, a manual laborer, and his wife Elisabeta (née Zaharia). After completing the Alexandru Ioan I commercial school in his native town , he finished high school, passing the exit examination at Iai. He also audited courses at Iai University's literature faculty. Neniescu attended an officers' school, volunteered in the Romanian War of Independence and was wounded at Grivitsa. He then studied at the philosophy faculty of Berlin University, taking a doctorate in 1887 at Leipzig University with a thesis on Baruch Spinoza. He worked as a schoolteacher and inspector in Bucharest. He traveled south of the Danube, a trip that resulted in an ample ethnic and statistical study of the AromaniansDe la românii din Turcia European, 1895). He sat in the Assembly of Deputies for his native Covurlui County, and also served as prefect of Tulcea County in the Dobruja region. Neniescu's first work appeared in the Galai newspaper Gardistul civic. A member of Junimea, he published numerous poems in its organ Convorbiri Literare. He also contributed to AlbinaAmicul copiilorRevista nouRomânul literareztoarea and Ziarul presei. While in Bucharest from 1884 to 1888, he published ara nou magazine, mainly submitting articles on pedagogy, ethics and sociology. His first book was the 1880 poetry volume Flori de primvar, followed by oimii de la Rzboieni (1882) and Pui de lei (1891). Of the plays he wrote, the only one he published was Radu de la Afumai (1897). In 1896, Neniescu was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. He died in Buzu.

tefan Niculescu( July 31, 1927 – January 22, 2008) was a Romanian composer. Niculescu was born in Moreni, Dâmbovita. He was credited with introducing his own brand of heterophony, a technique based on superimposing melodic material onto variations of itself in order to create textures that are propelled by thematic energy as well as by the more common textural factors of density and levels of activity. This creative approach bears similarities with György Ligeti's micropolyphony, but important aesthetic and stylistic differences set them apart. Niculescu's work as a teacher made him a mentor to a whole generation of younger Romanian composers, among them Dan Dediu. Niculescu's work Ison II for wind and percussion permutates simultaneous segments of a diatonic melody producing a reverberating complexity of sound which is held together by a strong sense of modal clarity.  Opus Dacicum for orchestra applies similar textural explorations but with a stronger sense of harmonic movement, often with a Wagnerian lushness that lends this music a sensuous appeal a world apart from Ligeti's cluster- oriented sonorities. Among his honors are many awards from the Romanian Academy and The Society of Romanian Composers. He also received awards from the Académie des Beaux- Arts in Paris( 1972), the International Record Critics Award( 1985), and the Herder Prize in Vienna( 1994). In the 1970s he contributed to the popularization of modern music by organizing public listenings in Bucharest together with erban Stnciulescu.

9,"Antiochus( 221 BC – 193 BC) was a Seleucid prince, first- born child to the Seleucid monarchs Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III, and his father's first heir.

Antiochus X Eusebes Philopator (–92 or 88 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as the King of Syria between 95 BC and 92 BC or 89/88 BC (224 SE (Seleucid year)). He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII. The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians. Numismatic evidence shows that AntiochusX was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital in SE (88/87 BC).

Antiochus II Epiphanes, also known as Antiochus II of Commagene (flourished 1st century BC) was a man of Armenian and Greek descent. Antiochus II was a prince from the Kingdom of Commagene and the second son of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene and Queen Isias Philostorgos. He was the youngest brother of prince and future king Mithridates II of Commagene. Very little is known of Antiochus II. In 29 BC, he was summoned to Rome by the Emperor Augustus for causing the assassination of an ambassador Mithridates II had sent to Rome. Antiochus II was subsequently executed on Augustus’ orders.

Ariarathes V Eusebes Philopator (Ariaráths Eusebs Philopátr; reigned 163–130 BC) was a son of the preceding king Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia and queen Antiochis. He was distinguished by his contemporaries for his excellence of his character and his cultivation of philosophy and the liberal arts and is considered by some historians to have been the greatest of the kings of Cappadocia.

Antiochus III Epiphanes (flourished 1st century BC and 1st century AD) was the ruler of the Kingdom of Commagene from 12 BC to 17 AD. He was the son and successor of King Mithridates III of Commagene and Iotapa, and of mixed Armenian, Greek and Median descent--the last through his mother. His parents were first cousins. When Antiochus died in 17 AD, his death created major issues for the kingdom, which was in political turmoil at the time. The reasons for this situation are unclear, but it may have been the consequence of his children, Antiochus and Iotapa, being too young to succeed their father. This may have meant that there was no effective authority to prevent civil unrest and unite the citizens of Commagene. Very little is known on his life and his reign as King. After Antiochus' death, two factions appeared: one led by noblemen who wanted Commagene to be placed under the rule of the Roman Empire and the other led by citizens who wanted Commagene's independence to be retained under the rule of their own king. Both factions sent embassies to Rome, seeking the advice and assistance of Emperor Tiberius to decide the future of Commagene. Tiberius decided to make Commagene a part of the Roman province of Syria. That decision was welcomed by many of the citizens by Commagene, which remained under Roman rule until Caligula restored the kingdom to Antiochus’ children in 38 AD. Antiochus III and his son are honoured on the Philopappos Monument in Athens, Greece, dedicated to his great-grandson, Prince Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos, who was a prominent and respected citizen in Athens. In the left figure of the monument is a statue of Antiochus III's son, Antiochus IV. Below Antiochus IV is an inscription that states King Antiochus son of King Antiochus.

20,"Do n't Look Now( lit.  In Venice ... a shocking red December) is a 1973 independent film directed by Nicolas Roeg. It is a thriller adapted from the short story by Daphne du Maurier. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland portray a married couple who travel to Venice following the recent accidental death of their daughter, after the husband accepts a commission to restore a church. They encounter two sisters, one of whom claims to be clairvoyant and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of danger. The husband at first dismisses their claims, but starts to experience mysterious sightings himself. While Do n't Look Now observes many conventions of the thriller genre, it focuses on the psychology of grief and the effect the death of a child can have on a relationship. Its depiction of grief has been identified as unusually strong for a film featuring supernatural plot elements.  Do n't Look Now is renowned for its innovative editing style, recurring motifs and themes, and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit by the standards of then- contemporary mainstream cinema. It also employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with the depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques. Its reputation has grown in the years since its release and it is now considered a classic and an influential work in horror and British film.

Comte Médéric de Vasselot de Régné ( 4 August 1837 – 23 April 1919) was a French- born forest officer trained at the National School of Forestry in Nancy, France, and appointed as Superintendent of Woods and Forests in South Africa in 1880. Médéric and his elder brother Marin Gabriel were sons of Jean Gabriel Charles Auguste de Vasselot de Régné( 1780 – 1842) and Eugénie Gabrielle Elisabeth Selima Vasselot de la Chesnaye( 1807 – 1879). Since the earliest days of European settlement at the Cape, the indigenous forests of the southern Cape were used as a seemingly inexhaustible source of timber and fuel. From 1652 when Jan van Riebeeck landed at the Cape until the 1880s, the forests and the fauna they supported were despoiled in the same way as those of the United States and Australia, with little or no thought given to sustainability. About 1776 a woodcutting centre was established at George, a step which heralded a century of plundering of the surrounding forests. An improved road between Swellendam and George saw an ever- increasing number of settlers and adventurers eager to participate in the timber boom. The perception was that of an unlimited resource, leading to excessively wasteful practices where only the choicest grades and sizes of timber were removed, and the majority of cut trees were simply left to rot. In 1778, the Governor Joachim van Plettenberg inspected the region and was appalled at the destruction. As a result, Johann Fredrick Meeding was appointed Resident at Plettenberg Bay in an effort to instil some form of control over the cutting. Meeding diligently performed his duties and his post survived a number of successive changes of government which followed British occupation of the Cape in 1795. Even so, no new conservation measures were introduced, and when Graaff- Reinet was founded in 1786 the timber boom resumed with wholesale cutting of the forests between George and Knysna, the official founding of George in 1811 aggravating the destruction. A further burden on the forests was the Royal Navy's extraction of timber to meet the needs of the dockyard at Simonstown, a situation which lasted until 1825 when iron saw an increasing use in boat- building. The withdrawal of the Navy's workers led to an immediate occupation of the vacated areas by new woodcutters. The start of the Great Trek in 1836 caused new waves of cutters from the Langkloof to invade the forests of the Tsitsikamma in the Humansdorp area. To make matters worse the Government decided in 1846 to sell the worked- out forests as agricultural lots. Of the remaining forest only a narrow strip stretching between the Keurbooms and Kaaimans Rivers were under State control and the local magistrate issued felling permits to woodcutters in an attempt to gather as much revenue as possible. By 1847 the situation had become so critical that all Crown Forests were declared closed. A Conservator of Forests was appointed assisted by 4 rangers. This protection was short- lived and in 1856 the forests were re-opened. The second Conservator of Forests was appointed at this time and was a retired Army officer, Captain Christopher Harison, a man with no forestry training, but with remarkable aptitude for his new career. He made himself familiar with European silviculture and adopted the practice of exploiting the forests in sections which led to better control and greatly reduced waste. He was also an outspoken critic of Crown Forest alienation and it was largely due to his efforts that this practice was stopped. The Colonial Botanist, Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe, issued dire warnings about the extent of destruction and became another voice supporting the growing conservation mood. The appointment of Captain Baron de Fin as Conservator of Forests at Keiskammahoek followed in 1865. Despite the warnings, matters carried on in much the same way until the great forest fire of February 1869 in which large parts of the forest between George and the Bloukrans River were completely destroyed. The matter was raised in Parliament and a commission consisting of Captain Harison and Thomas Bain was appointed. Following this Captain Harison was appointed as Conservator of Forests for the Knysna region in 1874. His work was bedevilled by the timber needs of the railway line to Kimberley and the short- lived gold rush at Millwood in 1876. De Vasselot's appointment as Superintendent of Woods and Forests followed in 1880. This was the first time that a professional forester had been put in charge and was a turning point in South African forestry. For the first time the authorities were persuaded that a sound silvicultural policy was of greater importance than the revenue derived from exploitation. The details of the new management system were spelled out in the Forest Regulation of 1883. When de Vasselot left the Cape in 1891, the forests of George, Knysna and the Tsitsikamma were being managed on a scientific basis. Two important publications by de Vasselot in 1885 were an Introduction to the Systematic Treatment of the Crown Forests of the Cape Colony and a pamphlet on Selection and Seasoning of Wood, both translated into English by the then Conservator of Transkeian Forests, A. W. Heywood. In 1898 Heywood was succeeded by Colin MacNaughton as Conservator at Knysna, where he marked out the first permanent sample plots in the forests to study indigenous tree communities, laying a valuable foundation for research into forest ecosystems. McNaughton strongly believed that the ‘ forests must be worked in the interests of the country, and not in the interests of the immediate population ’. That is, trees should be considered a national resource, and not relevant to the livelihood of communities who exploited the forest. De Vasselot is commemorated in the de Vasselot Nature Reserve surrounding Nature's Valley.

Lev Shcherba( commonly Scherba)( Russian:    , Belarusian:   )( – December 26, 1944) was a Russian linguist and lexicographer specializing in phonetics and phonology. Born in Igumen( Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire, now Chervyen, Belarus) to the family of an engineer. Shcherba went to high school in Kiev, graduating in 1898, and briefly attended Kiev University before moving to the capital and entering St. Petersburg University. There he studied under Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, graduating in 1903. In 1906 he traveled abroad, first to Leipzig and then to northern Italy, where he studied Tuscan dialects. During the autumn holidays of 1907 and 1908, on the advice of Baudouin de Courtenay, he studied the Sorbian languages, writing a description of the Mužakow dialect( spoken in the east, near Muskau). At the end of 1907 he went to Paris, where he worked in the experimental phonetics laboratory of Jean- Pierre Rousselot studying the phonetics of a series of languages using experimental methods; on his return to Russia he began setting up an experimental phonetics laboratory, paying for equipment from his own stipend, and this became the institution that now bears his name. As early as 1912, basing himself on the ideas of Baudouin de Courtenay, he elaborated the concept of the phoneme, defined by him as the grouping of sounds into sound types. In 1912 he defended his master's thesis and in 1915 received his doctorate from St. Petersburg University, where he was a professor from 1916 to 1941. He became the founder of the so- called Leningrad school of phonology, which included M. I. Matusevich and L. R. Zinder among others and carried on a polemic with the Moscow school. However, he spent the last few years of his life in Moscow, where he died. He became an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1943. Beyond phonology, Shcherba made significant contributions to the wider fields of linguistics and lexicography. In contrast to Ferdinand de Saussure, he recognized three rather than two objects of study: speech activity, language systems, and language material. He placed emphasis on the question of the capacity of the speaker to produce sentences never previously heard, a question which would become important to the linguistics of the later twentieth century. He also emphasized the importance of experiments in linguistics, particularly that of negative results, developing methods which became important for field study. He was the teacher of the lexicographer Sergei Ozhegov, author of the most widely used Russian dictionary. Shcherba is the author of the glokaya kuzdra sentence, which consists of words whose roots do not exist in Russian, but has correct construction in terms of Russian morphology and syntax — similar to Chomsky's Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. He invented this sentence to illustrate the distinction between grammar and vocabulary.

Dorothy Ashley- Cooper, Countess of Shaftesbury( c. 1656 – June 1698), formerly Lady Dorothy Manners, was the wife of Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 2nd Earl of Shaftesbury, and the mother of the 3rd Earl. She was the daughter of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland, and his wife, the former Frances Montagu, herself a daughter of Sir Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton.

This arrangement does not seem to have lasted very long, and it has been suggested that the 2nd Earl was not a promising pupil. In 1672, when his father became an earl, Dorothy's husband( by now an MP) became known as Lord Ashley and she as Lady Ashley. They had three children: Locke was the family's physician and assisted at the birth of the couple's eldest son and also attended Dorothy when she suffered a miscarriage.

John Adams (October 30, 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding Father who served as the second president of the United States, from 1797 to 1801. Before his presidency, he was a leader of the American Revolution that achieved independence from Great Britain and served as the first vice president of the United States. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in early American history, including his wife and adviser, Abigail. His letters and other papers serve as an important source of historical information about the era. A lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre. Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States' own constitution, as did his earlier Thoughts on Government. Adams was elected to two terms as vice president under President George Washington and was elected as the United States' second president in 1796. He was the first, and only, president elected under the banner of the Federalist Party. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts and built up the Army and Navy in the undeclared Quasi-War with France. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the White House. In his bid for reelection, opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Republicans led to Adams's loss to his former friend Thomas Jefferson, and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family, which includes their son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. John Adams died on July 4, 1826 – the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence – hours after Jefferson's death.

Adams served as captain of the Braintree Company at the Siege of Boston, and as a minuteman who fought on the Concord Green in 1775. He died of dysentery on August 10, 1775, at the age of 34, and was buried at what is today known as the Old Section of Union Cemetery in Holbrook, Massachusetts (then still a part of Braintree).

Blanche of France( 1313 – 26 April 1358), nun at Longchamp Abbey, was the fourth and youngest daughter of King Philip V of France and Countess Joan II of Burgundy. Blanche was born in 1313, before either of her parents ascended their respective thrones, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King Philip IV of France. She was named after her mother's ill- fated sister, Blanche of Burgundy. A year after Blanche's birth, her mother and both paternal aunts, Blanche and Margaret of Burgundy, were implicated in the Tour de Nesle Affair. The marriage of her parents was successful enough for her father to insist on her mother's acquittal, but her aunts were imprisoned. By the time Blanche was seven years old, her parents had become king and queen of France and Navarre and count and countess palatine of Burgundy. Queen Joan decided that her youngest daughter should join the Order of Saint Francis, probably wishing that the girl's cloistered life could compensate for the sins of her imprisoned namesake aunt. Blanche's mother did not make the decision easily, however, and not before procuring several papal dispensations that would serve to alleviate the harshness of monastic life. The Queen secured a special dispensation that allowed her and the King to visit their daughter frequently, but was later cautioned by the pope against visiting Blanche too often. Despite her religious vows, Blanche is more often mentioned as daughter of a French king by primary sources than any of her titled sisters- Countess Joan III of Burgundy, Countess Margaret I of Burgundy and Dauphine Isabella of Viennois. She is presumed to have at some point owned a richly decorated Franciscan breviary, the earliest known work of Jean Pucelle.

R. M. Ryan( born 1945 in Wisconsin) is the author of Vaudeville in the Dark( 2010), which was lauded by the New York Times as having been written at the juncture of rapture and rupture. He is also the author of two other volumes of poetry from Louisiana State University Press and two novels. R. M. Ryan ’s most recent book is a collection of poems and a personal meditation on surviving cancer called The Lost Roads Adventure Club( 2017). In 2015, Ryan published an autobiographical novel called There ’s A Man With a Gun Over There based on his experiences in the US Army as a detective and translator investigating black marketing in Germany during the Vietnam era. In this novel, Ryan, trained as poet and drafted into the military, is a kind of innocent abroad as he learns the very high price of essentially becoming a fascist for the American Empire and the remnants of Nazi Germany. Nominated by its publisher for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, There ’s a Man With a Gun Over There is about what could happen to anyone in the US Army, and a cautionary tale about America ’s War Machine. Publisher Martin Shepard describes the author as the Norman Mailer of this generation. Poet, screenwriter, playwright, and winner of a “ Genius ” Award from the MacArthur Foundation, Naomi Wallace comments that in reading the novel she is astonished by the battle of consciousness Ryan has with himself concerning right, wrong, war, lies: all are in continuous flux and deeply alive. Carol Polsgrove, author of Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement and Professor Emerita at The Indiana University School of Journalism, comments: R.M. Ryan ’s poems are not for the faint of heart. They saunter, they soar, they dive down to despair.  Vaudeville in the Dark brings together poems written over the last thirty years – since his publisher, Louisiana State University Press, brought out his first volume in 1980. That was right after he abandoned graduate school for stockbroking, which he has now abandoned for a writer ’s life. In an introduction of Ryan for a reading at Marquette University, professor and novelist C. J. Hribal said, Rick – R.M. – Ryan has quietly been writing some of the best poems of the new century: elegiac comedies, hymns to memory and to the small, incidental moments of our pasts that connect us to who we are now... these poems are generous in their humor and their sadness, they are wise and wounded, they are intensely human and humane. For six years, Ryan was the lyricist for the northern California rock- and- roll band The Thugz and wrote many of the songs on their two CD ’s released by Puffin records— Goin’ To Town( 2009) and Peace of Mind( 2011). Ryan also founded firestarter press, which has published eccentric artifacts by writers including Abby Frucht, Mark Strand, Tobias Wolff, Fred Chappell, and John Koethe. Ryan received his undergraduate degree in English at Cornell College, where he studied with Robert Dana, and his master's in Poetry from the University of Arkansas; he continued graduate studies( ABD) at Washington University in St. Louis with Howard Nemerov and John N. Morris, and later had a career as a writer and financial advisor for a brokerage company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He is married to the biographer Carol Sklenicka, author of Raymond Carver: A Writer ’s Life. He lives near the Sonoma Coast in California.

Nathan Nugent is an Irish film editor known for working with director Lenny Abrahamson. For Abrahamson, Nugent edited What Richard Did( 2012), Frank( 2014), and Room( 2015). At the 10th Irish Film& Television Awards in 2013, Nugent won Best Editing for What Richard Did. While working on Frank, Nugent told Abrahamson he would be interested in editing Room based on having read the novel of the same name. Nugent also served as second- unit director. He described his editing of Room as simplistic, keeping the acting intact, while working in Dublin for five months. However, child actor Jacob Tremblay's part was filmed in numerous takes so Tremblay could give variations of his performances of specific lines, so Abrahamson and Nugent had to assemble and splice the different takes in the editing process. For Room, a Canadian co-production, Nugent won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Editing in March 2016. In April, he won the Irish Film& Television Award for Best Editing.

62,"Alexandre Sacha Gaydamak (born May 1976 in France) is a French and Israeli businessman. A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be £32,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent £2.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.

Wong Kar-wai (born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama  As Tears Go By (1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles.  Days of Being Wild (1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express (1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 – April 21, 1910), known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, entrepreneur, publisher, and lecturer. He was lauded as the greatest humorist this country has produced, and William Faulkner called him the father of American literature. His novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), the latter often called The Great American Novel. Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter, contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens. He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. His humorous story, The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, was published in 1865, based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a miner. The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French. His wit and satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty. Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures, but he invested in ventures that lost most of it—such as the Paige Compositor, a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision. He filed for bankruptcy in the wake of these financial setbacks, but he eventually overcame his financial troubles with the help of Henry Huttleston Rogers. He eventually paid all his creditors in full, even though his bankruptcy relieved him of having to do so. Twain was born shortly after an appearance of Halley's Comet, and he predicted that he would go out with it as well; he died the day after the comet returned.

Formed in 1997, the group originally featured vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, lead guitarist Ben Weinman, rhythm guitarist Derek Brantley, bassist Adam Doll and drummer Chris Pennie, although Brantley left after only two shows. The remaining four members recorded the band's self-titled debut EP in 1997, before John Fulton replaced Brantley for the subsequent tour and 1998's Under the Running Board. Shortly after the second EP's release, Fulton left the band due to creative differences, and in early 1999 Doll was forced to cease involvement due to a spinal injury suffered in a road traffic accident. As a result, Weinman performed all guitars and bass on the band's full-length debut album Calculating Infinity, released in 1999. Following the release of Calculating Infinity, Brian Benoit replaced Fulton and Jeff Wood took Doll's place; Wood left the band in 2000 due to the ongoing effects of a gunshot wound to the head sustained in 1992, and was replaced by Liam Wilson. In April 2001, it was announced that Minakakis had decided to leave The Dillinger Escape Plan to pursue non-music related endeavors, with the band briefly placed on hiatus.

During a tour in 2006, tensions arose between Weinman and Pennie, with the guitarist briefly leaving the band citing undisclosed personal reasons. Pennie eventually left the band in 2007 to join Coheed and Cambria, with Gil Sharone replacing him for the band's third album Ire Works. Also in 2007, guitarist Jeff Tuttle was added to the band due to Love's unavailability. By the beginning of 2009, Sharone had left the band and been replaced by Billy Rymer.

What is the place of birth of Gwilym Lloyd George's father?",chorlton-on-medlock manchester,manchester,0.42007672786712646,0.3799783615910079,False
131,"Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby, (4 December 1894 – 14 February 1967) was a British politician and cabinet minister. The younger son of Prime Minister David Lloyd George, he served as Home Secretary from 1954 to 1957.

Richard Lloyd George, 2nd Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor (15 February 1889 – 1 May 1968) was a British soldier and peer in the peerage of the United Kingdom, a member of the House of Lords from 1945 until his death. The son of the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George by his first wife, Margaret Owen, Lloyd George was educated at Portmadoc School and Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1910. During the First World War he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers and rose to the rank of Major. He became an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and served in the British Army again during the Second World War. On 7 April 1917 Lloyd George married Roberta McAlpine (1898–1966), a daughter of Sir Robert McAlpine, 1st Baronet. They had two children, Valerie Davidia (1918–2000) and Owen (1924–2010), before being divorced in 1933. In 1935 Lloyd George married secondly Winifred Emily Peedle, a daughter of Thomas W. Peedle. Valerie became the wife of the academic and broadcasting executive, Sir Goronwy Daniel. On 1 January 1945 his father was created Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, and he gained the courtesy title of Viscount Gwynedd. Less than three months later, on 26 March 1945, his father died of cancer and he inherited his peerage, unusually becoming the first member of the family to sit in the House of Lords, as David Lloyd George had been too ill to do so. He wrote a biography of his mother, Dame Margaret, and of his father, Lloyd George.

David Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, (17 January 1863 – 26 March 1945) was a British statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1916 and 1922. He was the final Liberal to hold the post. Lloyd George was born in Manchester to Welsh parents. His father—a schoolmaster—died in 1864 and he was raised in Wales by his mother and her shoemaker brother, whose Liberal politics and Baptist faith strongly influenced Lloyd George; the same uncle helped the boy embark on a career as a solicitor after leaving school. Lloyd George became active in local politics, gaining a reputation as an orator and a proponent of a Welsh blend of radical Liberalism which championed nonconformism and the disestablishment of the Anglican church in Wales, equality for labourers and tenant farmers, and reform of landownership. In 1890, he narrowly won a by-election to become the Member of Parliament for Caernarvon Boroughs, in which seat he remained for fifty-five years. Lloyd George served in Henry Campbell-Bannerman's cabinet from 1905. After H. H. Asquith succeeded to the premiership in 1908, Lloyd George replaced him as Chancellor of the Exchequer. To fund extensive welfare reforms, he proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the People's Budget (1909), which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected. The resulting constitutional crisis was only resolved after two elections in 1910 and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. His budget was then enacted alongside the National Insurance Act 1911 which helped to establish the modern welfare state. In 1913, he was embroiled in the Marconi scandal but he remained in office and struggled to impose Irish Home Rule until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 suspended its implementation. As wartime Chancellor, Lloyd George strengthened the country's finances and forged agreements with trade unions to maintain production. In 1915, Asquith formed a Liberal-led wartime coalition with the Conservatives and Labour. Lloyd George became Minister of Munitions and rapidly expanded production. In 1916, he was appointed Secretary of State for War but was frustrated by his limited power and clashes with the military establishment over strategy. Amid stalemate on the Western Front, confidence in Asquith's leadership waned. He was forced to resign in December 1916; Lloyd George succeeded him as Prime Minister, supported by the Conservatives and some Liberals. He centralised authority through a smaller war cabinet, a new Cabinet Office and his Garden Suburb of advisers. To combat food shortages he implemented the convoy system, established rationing, and stimulated farming. After supporting the disastrous French Nivelle Offensive in 1917, he had to reluctantly approve Field Marshal Haig's plans for the Battle of Passchendaele which resulted in huge casualities with little strategic benefit. Against the views of his commanders, he was finally able to see the Allies brought under one command in March 1918. The war effort turned to their favour that August and was won in November. In the aftermath, he and the Conservatives maintained their coalition with popular support following the December 1918 Coupon election. His government had extended the franchise to all men and some women earlier in the year. Lloyd George was a major player in Paris Peace Conference of 1919 but the situation in Ireland worsened that year, erupting into the Irish War of Independence which lasted until Lloyd George negotiated independence for the Irish Free State in 1921. At home he initiated reforms to education and housing but trade union militancy entered record levels, the economy became depressed in 1920 and unemployment rose; spending cuts followed (1921–22) and he was embroiled in a scandal over the sale of honours and the Chanak Crisis in 1922. Bonar Law won backbench support for the Conservatives to contend the next election alone. Lloyd George resigned; with his party split between his and Asquith's supporters, his faction won less than 60 seats in the 1922 election. The next year the pair reunited to oppose Stanley Baldwin's tariff proposal which he put to the country. The Liberals made gains in 1923 but remained third after the Conservatives and Labour, propping up a Labour minority government; they never regained their status as second party and, when the Labour government fell, went down to just over 40 seats in 1924 under Asquith. Lloyd George led the Liberals from 1926 to 1931, putting forward innovative proposals for public works; this failed to convert into seats in 1929 and from 1931 he was a marginalised and mistrusted figure heading a small rump of breakaway Liberals opposed to the National Government. He declined an offer to serve in Winston Churchill's War Cabinet in 1940 and was raised to the peerage in 1945, shortly before his death. Lloyd George has often been ranked highly among modern British prime ministers, but his legacy remains complicated and controversial. Scholars have praised his welfare reforms and his efforts to mobilise and lead Britain to victory during the First World War, but he has also been criticised for adopting a presidential style of leadership, for distrusting his own commanders during the war, and for his strategic failures and involvement in various scandals. His legacies over Ireland and the Treaty of Versailles are also controversial. In the post-war period, he arguably alienated many of the workers he had earlier championed, helping to swell Labour's popular support at the Liberals' expense (not helped by his conflicts with Asquithian Liberals after 1916).

Prince George William of Hesse-Darmstadt (11 July 1722 – 21 June 1782) was a Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was born in Darmstadt. He was the second son of Landgrave Louis VIII and Charlotte Christine Magdalene Johanna of Hanau-Lichtenberg. From 1738 till his death he commanded an army-regiment of his land. In the 1740s, he also commanded a Prussian regiment. He reached the rank of general of the cavalry. He was the official military adviser to his father, but had a strong rival in his older brother Louis IX, who followed his friend's example, the soldier-king Frederick II of Prussia and expanded Pirmasens as a garrison town. In 1748, he married Countess Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Falkenburg. Through this marriage, he acquired the estates of Broich, Oberstein, Aspermont, Burgel and Reipolzkirchen. He and Maria had nine children. In 1764, George William received Old Palace in Darmstadt and the associated pleasure garden as a gift from his father, who had always favoured him above his brother Louis. George William had the palace with the White Tower expanded. He represented the reigning family in Darmstadt, as his brother stayed mostly in Pirmasens.

George I (George Louis; ; 28 May 1660 – 11 June 1727) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 1 August 1714 and ruler of the Duchy and Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover) in the Holy Roman Empire from 23 January 1698 until his death in 1727. He was the first British monarch of the House of Hanover. Born in Hanover to its Elector Ernest Augustus and Electress Sophia, George inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg from his father and uncles. A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime; he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover in 1708. After the deaths in 1714 of his mother and his second cousin Anne, Queen of Great Britain (r. 1702–1714), George ascended the British throne as Anne's closest living Protestant relative under the Act of Settlement 1701. Jacobites attempted, but failed, to depose George and replace him with James Francis Edward Stuart, Anne's Catholic half-brother. During George's reign, the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of cabinet government led by a prime minister. Towards the end of his reign, actual political power was held by Robert Walpole, now recognised as Britain's first de facto prime minister. George died of a stroke on a trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried. He is the most recent British monarch to be buried outside the United Kingdom.

Initially active as a music video director, he has worked primarily in the action and thriller film subgenres, and is best known for his Academy Award-winning film Training Day (2001). Fuqua began his career directing music videos for popular artists such as Toni Braxton, Coolio, Stevie Wonder and Prince. From 1998 onwards, he began directing feature films. Fuqua has expressed his early respect for Akira Kurosawa as a filmmaker and written about how Kurosawa influenced his own perspective on filmmaking.

Born in Tokyo, Japan, he attended Waseda University but left before graduating due to his involvement in a left- wing theater troupe. He joined P.C.L.( a precursor to Toho) in 1933 and began working as an assistant director to Kajir Yamamoto alongside his longtime friend, acclaimed Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa. He made his feature film directing debut in 1947 with Snow Trail, which was written by Kurosawa.  Snow Trail starred Toshir Mifune in his film debut and actress Setsuko Wakayama.

Who is Philip Of Sicily's father?",king philip ii of france,charles i of naples,0.650701105594635,0.1506401849870651,False
149,"Prince Philip of Bourbon- Two Sicilies( Filippo Maria Alfonso Antonio Ferdinando Francesco di Paola Lodovico Enrico Alberto Taddeo Francesco Saverio Uberto; 10 December 1885 – 9 March 1949) was a member of the House of Bourbon- Two Sicilies and a Prince of Bourbon- Two Sicilies.

Philip (born 1255/56, died 1277), of the Capetian House of Anjou, was the second son of King Charles I of Sicily and Countess Beatrice of Provence. He was at various times set up to become King of Sardinia, Prince of Achaea or King of Thessalonica, but ultimately ascended no throne.

Marcus Julius Philippus Severus, also known as Philippus II, Philip II and Philip the Younger( 238 – 249) was the son and heir of the Roman Emperor Philip the Arab by his wife Marcia Otacilia Severa. According to numismatic evidence, he had a sister called Julia Severa or Severina, whom the extant literary sources do not mention, and a brother, Quintus Philippus Severus. When his father became emperor in 244, the younger Philip was appointed Caesar. In 247 he became consul, and was later elevated by his father to the rank of Augustus and co-ruler. His father was killed in battle by his successor Decius in 249. When news of this death reached Rome, Philip was murdered by the Praetorian Guard. He died in his mother's arms, aged twelve years.

Peter II (1304 – 8 August 1342) was the King of Sicily from 1337 until his death, although he was associated with his father as co-ruler from 1321. Peter's father Frederick III of Sicily and his mother was Eleanor, a daughter of Charles II of Naples. His reign was marked by strife between the throne and the nobility, especially the old families of Ventimiglia, Palizzi and Chiaramonte, and by war between Sicily and Naples. Contemporaries regarded Peter as feeble-minded. Giovanni Villani, in his Nuova Cronica, calls him almost an imbecile (Italianate Latin: quasi un mentacatto) and Nicola Speciale, in his Historia Sicula, calls him pure and simplepurus et simplex). Under Peter, the Neapolitans conquered the Lipari Islands and took the cities of Milazzo and Termini in Sicily itself. He died after a short illness on 8 August 1342 in Calascibetta and was buried in the cathedral of Palermo. He was succeeded by Louis, his eldest son, who was only four years old.

Philip of Castile (Seville, 28 May 1292 – Madrid, April 1327), was an infante of Castile, son of Sancho IV of Castile and María de Molina. He was Lord of Cabrera and Ribera and regent of his nephew Alfonso XI of Castile. He married his cousin Margarita de la Cerda, daughter of Alfonso de la Cerda.

In 1859 he took over the family farm Ekeberg in the parish of Enebakk (Ekeberg gård i Enebakk). In 1866, he established Jølsens Tændstikfabrik, which developed into one of the larger match factory in Norway in the 1870s, with about 300 employees. In 1886, the factory was re-located from Ekebergdalen to Bryn in Aker. In 1887 he established Enebak Cellulosefabrik, which was one of the first pulp mills in Norway. Following a large fire in 1893, Jølsen was bankrupt. Holm Jølsen was married to Pauline Lovise Holmsen (1836–1903). Their daughter Ragnhild Jølsen (1875-1908) was the subject of the book Drømmen og hjulet written by Jens Bjørneboe and published in 1964.

Oscar Ihlebæk ( 9 October 1900 – 10 March 1945) was a Norwegian newspaper editor and resistance member. He was born in Drammen, to a mother from Skoger and a father from Rakkestad.

He was a journalist in his hometown newspaper Fremtiden, then the main organ of the Social Democratic Labour Party, Den nye Social- Demokraten, before becoming a subeditor in Bergens Arbeiderblad in 1927. He was promoted to editor- in- chief in 1939. He was a board member of the Norwegian Press Association from 1936, and from 1939 he was a deputy board member in Den Nationale Scene. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he was fired by the Nazi authorities in November 1940. He joined the Norwegian resistance movement, but was captured.

Gideon Johnson Pillow (June 8, 1806 – October 8, 1878) was an American lawyer, politician, speculator, slaveowner, United States Army major general of volunteers during the Mexican–American War and Confederate brigadier general in the American Civil War. Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican–American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career. He died near Helena, Arkansas in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.

Wong Kar-wai (born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama  As Tears Go By (1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles. Days of Being Wild (1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express (1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

The General Died at Dawn is a 1936 American drama film that tells the story of a mercenary who meets a beautiful girl while trying to keep arms from getting to a vicious warlord in war-torn China. The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham Two-Gun Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China. This is reported to be the first film to use foam latex prosthetics. Makeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors. John Howard Reid called it one of the fifty finest films Hollywood ever made.

What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?",hranice,wales,0.0889718309044838,0.0,False
193,"Eiludd Powys was an early 7th-century King of Powys. One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf Sarffgadau ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.

Beli ap Eiludd was a 7th- century King of Powys. Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. It is more likely however that as the genealogies state he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf, the former being the most likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw painting the Mathrafal dynasty as being descendants of Selyf. It was also likely if Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.

Maredudd ap Bleddyn (1047 – 9 February 1132) was a prince and later King of Powys in eastern Wales. Maredudd was the son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn who was King of both Powys and Gwynedd. When Bleddyn was killed in 1075, Powys was divided between three of his sons, Iorwerth, Cadwgan and Maredudd.

Gwylog ap Beli was one of the rulers of the Kingdom of Powys during the late 7th to early 8th Century, son of Beli ap Eiludd. There is also a small possibility his mother was Heledd ferch Cyndrwyn the narrator of the Canu Heledd, being that she would have been welcomed by his father Beli after the defeat at Maes Cogwy.

He died at Madrid on 10 November 1644. Velez de Guevara was the author of over four hundred plays, of which the best are Reinar despues de morirLa Luna de la Sierra, and El Diablo está en Cantillana. The play Más pesa el rey que la sangre, which translates into The King weighs more than blood( kinship) is based on the episode of the Reconquista in which the nobleman Alonso Pérez de Guzmán allows his son to be sacrificed, rather than surrender his King's possession of Tarifa. However, Vélez de Guevara is most widely known as the author of El diablo cojuelo( 1641, The Lame Devil or The Crippled Devil), a fantastic novel which suggested to Alain- René Lesage the idea for Le Diable boiteux( 1707). The plot presents a rascal student that hides in an astrologer's mansard. He frees a devil from a bottle. As an acknowledgement the devil shows him the apartments of Madrid and the tricks, miseries and mischiefs of their inhabitants. A similar theme was suggested by the magic lenses in Los anteojos de mejor vista( 1620 – 1625) by Rodrigo Fernández de Ribera. Charles Dickens refers to El Diablo cojuelo in The Old Curiosity Shop, chapter thirty- three.

Juan Crisóstomo Vélez de Guevara (Madrid, 1611 – íbid., 20 November 1675), son of Luis Vélez de Guevara, was, like his father, a playwright of the Spanish Golden Age. Like his father Luis, Juan Vélez entered the service of the Duque de Veragua as a lawyer, and from there in 1642 succeeded his father as an Usher of the Royal Chamber. Well known in his day as a composer of short theatrical pieces, notably entremeses and bailes, many of them performed at the Spanish Court , Vélez junior likewise wrote and published full-length plays such as El diciembre por agosto, Nuestra Señora de las Nieves (1637), Endimión y la luna (1656), and the zarzuela Los celos hacen estrella (1672). He also wrote, in collaboration, Amor vencido de Amor (with Juan de Zabaleta and Antonio de la Huerta); La verdad en el engaño (with Jerónimo de Cáncer and Martínez de Meneses); the burlesque Los siete infantes de Lara (1650, with Jerónimo de Cáncer); and La cortesana en la sierra and El hidalgo de La Mancha (with Juan Bautista Diamante and Juan de Matos Fragoso).

214,"George Orson Welles( May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, writer and producer who is remembered for his innovative work in radio, theatre and film. He is considered one of the greatest film directors of all time. While in his twenties Welles directed a number of high- profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project, including an adaptation of Macbeth with an entirely African American cast and the political musical The Cradle Will Rock. In 1937 he and John Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941, including Caesar( 1937), a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. In 1938, his radio anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air gave Welles the platform to find international fame as the director and narrator of a radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds, which caused widespread panic because many listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring. Although some contemporary sources say these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to notoriety. His first film was Citizen Kane( 1941), which is consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made, which he co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles released twelve other features, the most acclaimed of which include The Magnificent Ambersons( 1942), The Lady from Shanghai( 1947), Touch of Evil( 1958), The Trial( 1962), Chimes at Midnight( 1966) and F for Fake( 1973). Welles was an outsider to the studio system, and struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios in Hollywood and later in life with a variety of independent financiers across Europe, where he spent most of his career. Many of his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. Some, like Touch of Evil, have been painstakingly re-edited from his notes. With a development spanning almost 50 years, Welles's final film, The Other Side of the Wind, was released in 2018. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots and long takes. He has been praised as the ultimate auteur. Welles had three marriages, including one with Rita Hayworth, and three children. Known for his baritone voice, Welles performed extensively across theatre, radio and film. He was a lifelong magician noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years. In 2002 he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics. He was also included in the list of the 50 greatest Hollywood actors of all time by The Telegraph UK.

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques, which are critically recognized as among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including The Mystery of Picasso, which was declared a national treasure by the government of France. Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French- language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German- owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947. After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa mère, Clouzot married Véra Gibson- Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La Vérité, Clouzot's wife Véra died of a heart attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.

Ashok Mehta's journey is a rags to riches story. He ran away from home at the age of 14 and came to Mumbai. With no money, no acquaintance and no shelter he had nowhere to go and to survive he started selling stuff like boiled eggs, fruits etc. His Journey in the Bollywood started as a canteen boy, office boy and then a camera attendant. After a decade- long struggle in the Indian film industry, he finally became the DOP. He got his first break as a cinematographer at the age of 25 in Raj Marbros' The Witness. He credits his actual career boost to the reigning star of the 1970s, Shashi Kapoor.

Where did the director of film Ręce Do Góry study?",the director studied in poland,national film school in łódź,0.5803136825561523,0.11234277891542777,False
218,"Rce do góry (known in its subtitled English version as Hands Up!) is a Polish drama film directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. It is the fourth of a series of semi-autobiographical films in which Skolimowski himself plays his alter ego, Andrzej Leszczyc. At the time it was banned in Poland, under the Communist regime, for 18 years because it depicted the Stalinist past. The film was originally made in 1967 in monochrome by studio. In a twenty-minute section (filmed in colour) added by Skolimowski in 1981 he explains how the original was withheld by Polish censors of the time, and that this was a principal cause of his leaving his country; however following liberalisation in Poland, he was invited to resuscitate it. The introduction includes, apart from some fictional apocalyptic passages, shots of Beirut ruined by the civil wars of the 1970s, where Skolimowski is working as an actor on Volker Schloendorff's German film Die Fälschung (Circle of Deceit), and also shots of London featuring demonstrations in favour of Solidarnosc, Speaker's Corner, and an exhibition of Skolimowski's own paintings. These sections include cameo roles by Bruno Ganz, David Essex, Mike Sarne and others. Some of the music in this introduction is from the 1970 choral work Kosmogonia by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. The original film is a surrealistic reunion of Leszczyc (who has apparently become a veterinary surgeon) and some of his student colleagues. They refer to themselves by the makes of the cars they own - Leszczyc owns a Zastawa, one owns a Wartburg, the others own more upmarket models such as an Opel Rekord or the Alfa Romeo owned by the unhappily married couple. Supposedly taking speed (although it is later revealed the pills are a placebo), and carousing in the cattle truck of a freight train, the group offers various satirical sidelights on Polish society of the 1960s. The characters also reflect that the truck may have been one of those in which the former generation were transported during World War II to the Nazi death camps. The final credits show the actors as they are in 1981, with the exception of Bogumil Kobiela, who died in 1969. The film was screened out of competition at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.

Nora Bernard( September 22, 1935 – December 26, 2007) was a Canadian Mi'kmaq activist who sought compensation for survivors of the Canadian Indian residential school system. She was directly responsible for what became the largest class- action lawsuit in Canadian history, representing an estimated 79,000 survivors; the Canadian government settled the lawsuit in 2005 for upwards of 5 billion dollars. In 1945, when Bernard was 9 years old, her mother was told that if she did not sign the consent forms to send her children to a residential school, the child welfare system would take her children into protective custody; as a result, Bernard attended the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for five years. In 1955, she married a non-native man, and consequently lost her legal status under the Indian Act; the relevant section of the Indian Act was repealed in 1985, but this did not automatically lead to reinstatement as a band member, and it was not until March 2007 that she was voted back into the Millbrook First Nation. In 1995, Bernard began an organization to represent survivors of the Shubenacadie school; she subsequently convinced Halifax lawyer John McKiggan to represent the Shubenacadie survivors in a class- action suit. After the Shubenacadie suit became public knowledge, many other survivors' associations across Canada filed similar suits; these were eventually amalgamated into one national lawsuit. In McKiggan's words, if it was n't for Nora's efforts, and other survivors like her across Canada, this national settlement never would have happened. After we filed our lawsuit, a number of other students from other schools filed similar class actions. In 2005, she testified before the House of Commons of Canada about the abuse children suffered in residential schools: On December 27, 2007, Bernard was found dead in her home in Truro, Nova Scotia; although she was originally thought to have died of natural causes, on December 31, police arrested her grandson James Douglas Gloade and charged him with her murder. She had been stabbed to death. On January 23, 2009, Gloade was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison. In 2008 Bernard was posthumously awarded the Order of Nova Scotia.

William Seward Burroughs III (July 21, 1947 – March 3, 1981) was an American novelist, also known as William S. Burroughs Jr. and Billy Burroughs. He bears the name of both his father and his great grandfather, William Seward Burroughs I, the original inventor of the Burroughs adding machine. He wrote three novels, two of which were published as Speed (1970) and Kentucky Ham (1973). His third novel, Prakriti Junction, begun in 1977, was never completed, although extracts from it were included in his third and final published work Cursed From Birth. Burroughs Jr. underwent a liver transplant in 1976 after developing cirrhosis. He died in 1981, at the age of 33, from alcoholism and liver failure. Burroughs Jr. appears briefly in the 1983 documentary , about his father, in which he discusses his childhood, his liver problems, and his relationship with his family. In the documentary, John Giorno calls him the last beatnik.

James Grauerholz( born December 14, 1953) is a writer and editor. He is the bibliographer and literary executor of the estate of William S. Burroughs.

William Seward Burroughs II (February 5, 1914 – August 2, 1997) was an American writer and visual artist. Burroughs was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was also briefly known by the pen name William Lee. Burroughs created and exhibited thousands of paintings and other visual artworks, including his celebrated 'Gunshot Paintings'. He was born into a wealthy family in St. Louis, Missouri, grandson of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation, William Seward Burroughs I, and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties. He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University, studied English, and anthropology as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy, after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life, while working a variety of jobs. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, and out of their mutual influence grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture. Much of Burroughs' work is semiautobiographical, primarily drawn from his experiences as a heroin addict, as he lived throughout Mexico City, London, Paris and the Tangier International Zone near Morocco, as well as from his travels in the South American Amazon. His work also features frequent mystical, occult or otherwise magical themes – a constant preoccupation for Burroughs, both in fiction and in real life. Burroughs killed his second wife, Joan Vollmer, in 1951 in Mexico City. Burroughs initially claimed that he shot Vollmer while drunkenly attempting a William Tell stunt. He later told investigators a different story: that he had been showing his pistol to friends, when it fell and hit the table, firing the bullet that killed Vollmer. After Burroughs returned to the United States, he was convicted of manslaughter in absentia, and received a two-year suspended sentence. Burroughs found success with his confessional first novel, Junkie (1953), but he is perhaps best known for his third novel Naked Lunch (1959), a highly controversial work that was the subject of a court case after it was challenged as being in violation of the U.S. sodomy laws. With Brion Gysin, he also popularized the literary cut-up technique in works such as The Nova Trilogy (1961–1964). In 1983, Burroughs was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and in 1984 he was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France. Jack Kerouac called Burroughs the greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift, a reputation he owes to his lifelong subversion of the moral, political, and economic systems of modern American society, articulated in often darkly humorous sardonicism. J. G. Ballard considered Burroughs to be the most important writer to emerge since the Second World War, while Norman Mailer declared him the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius. Burroughs created visual art throughout his lifetime, but never exhibited it until 1987, after the death of his friend and collaborator Brion Gysin. For the next and last 10 years of his life, he presented his paintings and drawings at museums and galleries worldwide. Burroughs had one child, William S. Burroughs Jr. (1947–1981), with his second wife Joan Vollmer. William Burroughs died at his home in Lawrence, Kansas, after suffering a heart attack in 1997.

Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a 2002 biographical spy comedy film depicting the fictional life of popular game show host and producer Chuck Barris, who claimed to have also been an assassin for the CIA. The film was George Clooney's directorial debut, was written by Charlie Kaufman and starred Sam Rockwell, Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, and George Clooney himself. Columbia Pictures had planned to produce a film adaptation of Barris's 1984 unauthorized autobiography of the same title in the late 1980s. When the film rights were purchased by producer Andrew Lazar, Kaufman was commissioned to write a new script, which attracted various A-list actors and filmmakers to the project. Bryan Singer at one point planned to direct the film with Johnny Depp in the lead role, but the production was canceled. The production resumed when Clooney took over directing duties. Barris remained heavily involved in production in an attempt to portray the film from his point of view. To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts to lower their salaries. The film was released to respectful reviews from critics and was modestly successful at the box office. Rockwell, in particular, was praised for his acting and won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival.

Scarface is a 1983 American crime drama film directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. It is a remake of the 1932 film and tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana( Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug lord. The cast also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983. The film was shot in Louisville and in Los Angeles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Giorgio Moroder. De Palma dedicated this version of Scarface after the writers of the original, Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht.  Scarface was released on December 9, 1983 and grossed$ 44 million at the domestic box office and$ 65.9 million worldwide.

Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, however, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre, and one of the greatest remakes ever. Screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, and it has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in hip hop music as well as comic books, television programs, and video games, although over the years, the film has been regarded as a cult film.

235,"Hunter is a song recorded by Icelandic musician Björk for her third studio album Homogenic (1997). The lyrics explore the pressure Björk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The song was first performed at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later included with the online promotional release of Homogenic; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Björk and Mark Bell, Hunter features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission. Most music critics were enticed by Hunter, which they declared one of the highlights of the Homogenic album. The single charted poorly, peaking at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart and number 55 on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. The accompanying music video for Hunter was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Björk as she transforms into a techno-bear while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics. Björk has performed Hunter on  Later... with Jools Holland and in five of her tours, the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour.

Following the death of Georgiana's father, her mother married Charles Culling Smith and had a daughter and a son. She married the future duke on 25 July 1814, when he was known as Marquess of Worcester. He had been a junior officer under her uncle, the Duke of Wellington, who gave Georgiana away at the wedding. The following week, the marquess's uncle, Lord FitzRoy Somerset, married another of Wellington's nieces, Lady Emily Harriet Wellesley-Pole; she was also given away by the duke. Georgiana was a friend of Princess Charlotte of Wales (died 1817), the daughter of the Prince of Wales (the future King George IV of the United Kingdom), and her engagement to Somerset was announced at a ball given by the prince at Carlton House.

It is sad to contrast all this brilliancy with the cold and dreary grave that will so soon close over her; and yet she will then have more tranquility, for her prospects were not happy ones.

Her deathbed was attended by wild exhibitions of grief from many of her female friends, who were distraught by the great pain she endured. Her last words were I never thought death could hurt so much. A year after the death of his wife, on 29 June 1822, the Marquess of Worcester married her younger half-sister, Emily Frances Smith. Under church law, the proximity of the relationship meant that the marriage could have been voided during the couple's lifetime; this was one of several cases that led to changes in the law under the Marriage Act 1836. The marriage led to a bitter quarrel between the Duke of Wellington, who opposed it and his sister Anne, Emily and Georgiana's mother, who supported it, and they were never close again.

Holding the position of comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household for the next nineteen years, Conroy also acted as her confidant and political agent, among other roles. Together, they designed the Kensington System, an elaborate and strict system of rules for the upbringing of young Victoria, designed to render her weak- willed and utterly dependent upon them in the hope of allowing them one day to wield power through her. Princess Victoria grew to hate Conroy, thanks to the oppressive system, and he was also unpopular among the rest of the British royal family. His efforts to place the Duchess in the role of regent were ultimately unsuccessful, as Victoria ascended the throne after reaching her majority in 1837. Conroy was immediately expelled from Victoria's household, though he remained in the Duchess of Kent's service for several more years. Given a pension and a baronetcy, Conroy retired to his estate near Reading, Berkshire, in 1842 and died heavily in debt twelve years later. Historians have often referred to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, with varying degrees of positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked to hear this, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.

Tomás Gutiérrez Alea (December 11, 1928 – April 16, 1996) was a Cuban filmmaker. He wrote and directed more than 20 features, documentaries, and short films, which are known for his sharp insight into post-Revolutionary Cuba, and possess a delicate balance between dedication to the revolution and criticism of the social, economic, and political conditions of the country. Gutiérrez's work is representative of a cinematic movement occurring in the 1960s and 1970s known collectively as the New Latin American Cinema. This collective movement, also referred to by various writers by specific names such as “Third Cinema”, “Cine Libre”, and “Imperfect Cinema,” was concerned largely with the problems of neocolonialism and cultural identity. The movement rejected both the commercial perfection of the Hollywood style, and the auteur-oriented European art cinema, for a cinema created as a tool for political and social change. Due not in a small part to the filmmakers’ lack of resources, aesthetic was of secondary importance to cinema's social function. The movement's main goal was to create films in which the viewer became an active, self-aware participant in the discourse of the film. Viewers were presented with an analysis of a current problem within society that as of that time had no clear solution, hoping to make the audience aware of the problem and to leave the theater willing to become actors of social change.

Eleanor of England (18 June 1269 – 29 August 1298) was an English princess, the eldest surviving daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen Eleanor of Castile. What evidence exists for Eleanor's early years suggests that while her parents were absent on Crusade between 1270 and 1274, she became very close to her paternal grandmother, Eleanor of Provence, with whom she continued to spend a good deal of time. She was also close to her sickly brother Henry. On one Pentecost Eve, Henry and Eleanor were given two partridges for their dinner, for a special treat. For a long period Eleanor was betrothed to King Alfonso III of Aragon. Alfonso's parents were under papal interdict, however, because of their claims to the throne of Sicily, which were contrary to the papal donation of the Sicilian throne to Charles I of Naples, and despite the Aragonese ruler's repeated pleas that Edward I send his daughter to them for marriage, Edward refused to send her as long as the interdict remained in place. In 1282 he declined one such request by saying that his wife and mother felt the girl, who had just turned 13, was too young to be married, and that they wanted to wait another two years before sending her to Aragon. Alfonso died before the marriage could take place. Eleanor subsequently married the French nobleman, Henry III, Count of Bar on September 20, 1293, and had two children: According to Kenneth Panton, Eleanor is credited with a daughter called Eleanor (b.1285), who supposedly married a Welshman named Llywelyn ap Owain.

She brought as her dowry her titles of Pontarcy and de Brie-Comte-Robert, which had been named after her ancestor Robert I of Dreux.

Sancho Ramírez (1042 – 4 June, 1094) was King of Aragon from 1063 until 1094 and King of Pamplona from 1076 under the name of Sancho V . He was the eldest son of Ramiro I and Ermesinda of Bigorre. His father was the first king of Aragon and an illegitimate son of Sancho III of Pamplona. He inherited the Aragonese crown from his father in 1063. Sancho Ramírez was chosen king of Pamplona by Navarrese noblemen after Sancho IV was murdered by his siblings.

Sancho Ramírez (Basque: Antso Ramirez; dead c. 1002) was the second King of Viguera, from 981 until his death c. 1002. He was the eldest son of Ramiro Garcés, the first king of Viguera, and also grandson of García Sánchez I of Pamplona. Little is known about his reign in Viguera. Following the death of his father, he appears in documents with his uncle Sancho II Garcés and his brother García Ramírez. His death is commonly estimated at about 999, but a recently published document shows him still living in 1002. In that year, between the last appearance of García Sánchez II of Pamplona in 1000 and the first appearance of Sancho III of Navarre in 1004, he appears as king in a context that suggests a greater domain than simply Viguera. It has been used to suggest that Sancho Ramírez served briefly as ruler of Pamplona itself in the same manner that Jimeno Garcés of Pamplona had ruled during the youth of García Sánchez I. This 1002 document is the last in which he is found, and he is presumed to have died shortly thereafter. A woman named Sancha Sánchez appears in Pamplona royal charters in a position of importance, and has been speculated to be his daughter, but her fate is unknown. He was succeeded in the throne by his brother García Ramírez.

268,"It Happened at the World's Fair is a 1963 American musical film starring Elvis Presley as a cropdusting pilot. It was filmed in Seattle, Washington, site of the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. The governor of Washington at the time, Albert Rosellini, suggested the setting to Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer executives. The film made$ 2.25 million at the box office.

State Fair is a 1962 American musical film directed by José Ferrer and starring Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Ann-Margret, Tom Ewell, Pamela Tiffin and Alice Faye. A remake of the 1933 film State Fair and the 1945 State Fair films, it was considered to be a financially and critically unsuccessful film. Richard Rodgers wrote additional songs, both music and lyrics, for this 1962 version of the novel to film adaptation. His partner, Oscar Hammerstein, had died in 1960. While the 1933 and 1945 versions were set at the Iowa State Fair, this 1962 version was set in Texas (the family drives through Dallas where the State Fair of Texas is held). It was filmed on soundstages at Twentieth Century Fox in California, at various locations in Texas, at Mooney's Grove park in Visalia, California, and the climactic speedway sequence was filmed on location at the Oklahoma State Fair Raceway in Oklahoma City where the Oklahoma State Fair is held.. The Tilt-A-Whirl that was used in the film is currently at a small theme park in Golden, Colorado. The novel State Fair would be dramatized twice more following the 1962 film. The first State Fair stage musical, which utilized a variety of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs (many originally written for projects not related to their State Fair film), was first produced in 1969. A revised version of this stage musical was produced in the 1990s and eventually played on Broadway. A non-musical version of State Fair was filmed for televsion in 1976.

The IND World's Fair Line, officially the World's Fair Railroad, was a temporary branch of the Independent Subway System( IND) serving the 1939 New York World's Fair in Queens, New York City. It split from the IND Queens Boulevard Line at an existing flying junction east of Forest Hills – 71st Avenue station, ran through the Jamaica Yard and then ran northeast and north through Flushing Meadows – Corona Park, roughly along the current path of the Van Wyck Expressway. The line continued along a wooden trestle to the World's Fair Railroad Station, located slightly south of Horace Harding Boulevard( now the Long Island Expressway). The World's Fair station, the only one on the line, consisted of two tracks and three platforms. The line was planned beginning in 1936, and it was constructed in 1938. The line and station were only open in 1939 and 1940 during the Fair's operating season. Passengers had to pay a ten- cent fare to use this line, double the subway's standard five- cent fare. This was not the only line to serve the world's fair. The Interborough Rapid Transit and the Brooklyn Manhattan Transit operated service to the Fair via the World's Fair station of their joint- operated IRT Flushing Line. The World's Fair Railroad and station are the only IND line and station to have been closed and demolished. Remnants of the line are still present in the Jamaica Yard.

A Century of Progress International Exposition was a World's Fair registered under the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), which was held in Chicago, as The Chicago World's Fair, from 1933 to 1934 to celebrate the city's centennial. The theme of the fair was technological innovation. The fair's motto was Science Finds, Industry Applies, Man Adapts, giving out a message that science and American life were wedded. Its architectural symbol was the Sky Ride, a transporter bridge perpendicular to the shore on which one could ride from one side of the fair to the other.

All About Eve received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics upon its release on October 13, 1950, at a New York City premiere. The film's competitor, Sunset Boulevard, released the same year, drew similar praise, and the two were often favorably compared. Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times loved the film, stating that a fine Darryl Zanuck production, excellent music and an air of ultra-class complete this superior satire. Variety called it a literate, adult film with exceedingly well-cast performances, while Harrison's Reports called it a fascinating, continually absorbing story about Broadway theatrical people, given a mature treatment and penetrated with realistic dialogue and flashes of slick, sardonic humor. John McCarten of The New Yorker called it a thoroughly entertaining movie.

Who is the spouse of the performer of song Lolita (Leah Labelle Song)?",rasual butler,rasual butler,1.0,1.0000000000000002,True
269,"Lolita is a song recorded by American singer Leah LaBelle. It was released on May 7, 2013 through Epic. The single was written by American songwriter Kelly Sheehan in collaboration with record producer Pharrell Williams. Backed by synthesizers and a bass guitar, it is a midtempo funk, R&B, and pop song with disco influences. Media commentators have suggested the song was inspired by Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel Lolita, and noted that its lyrics greatly diverge from the source material. Lolita was positively received by music critics, who praised its chorus, Williams' production, and LaBelle's vocal performance. The single ranked number seven on the Dance Club Songs Billboard chart in the United States. Internationally, it peaked at number 264 on the official Tophit airplay chart. To promote Lolita, LaBelle sang an acoustic version for Rap-Up, and performed the original version at various venues, such as New York Fashion Week and the Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend. Directed by Diane Martel, the single's accompanying music video features LaBelle as Lolita and shows how she seduces boys from her neighborhood. The video received attention due to its focus on sexuality. Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church strongly criticized Martel's creation of sexually-explicit music videos, and Idolator selected the carwash scene as an instance in which the video emphasized sexuality. Despite the criticism, LaBelle's performance garnered positive reviews.

 Lolita is a song by Mexican singer Belinda, released as the first promotional single from her third studio album Carpe Diem. The song was composed by Jimmy Harry, Alaina Beaton, Belinda and Nacho Peregín.

 Lolita( trop jeune pour aimer)( meaning Lolita( Too Young to Love)) is the third single from Celine Dion's album Incognito, released on 21 September 1987 in Quebec, Canada. The song was composed and produced by Jean Roussel and the lyrics were written by Luc Plamondon.

Lolita is a 1962 comedy- drama film directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on the 1955 novel of the same title by Vladimir Nabokov, who also wrote the screenplay. It follows a middle- aged literature lecturer who becomes sexually obsessed with a young adolescent girl. The film stars James Mason as Humbert Humbert, Sue Lyon as Dolores Haze( Lolita), and Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze, with Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. Owing to the Motion Picture Association of America's( MPAA) restrictions at the time, the film toned down the most provocative aspects of the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination. The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon, was 14 at the time of filming.  Lolita polarized contemporary critics, but is well- received today. Kubrick later commented, however, that if he had realized how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, he probably would never have made the film.

David Secter is a Canadian film director. He is best known for the 1965 film Winter Kept Us Warm, the first English Canadian film ever screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Widely considered a key milestone in the development of Canadian film, Winter Kept Us Warm was a gay themed independent film written, directed and funded entirely by Secter, who is gay, while he was a student at the University of Toronto. Secter subsequently released a second film in Canada, The Offering in 1966, and entered discussions with CBC Television to produce a drama series for the network. However, before that series was launched, he moved to New York City to pursue opportunities in the much larger American film and theatre industry. He was initially slated to direct Cher's 1969 film Chastity, but dropped out of the project. In New York, he lived with several other experimental filmmakers in a clothing- optional, drug and sex- friendly commune, and worked as a theatre director. He released the low- budget sex comedy Getting Together( also titled Feelin' Up in some releases) in 1976, and subsequently moved to Los Angeles. He did not work on another film until Cyberdorm in 1997. In the early 1990s, Secter's nephew Joel rented Getting Together from his local video store in Winnipeg, not knowing that his uncle had directed films. After discovering his uncle's name in the credits, Joel contacted David to discuss his career in film. These discussions culminated in Joel Secter's own debut as a filmmaker, the 2005 documentary The Best of Secter& the Rest of Secter. In the film, David also revealed that he is HIV- positive.

She was the youngest girl born to Charles Henry Smith, an investment broker, and Katherine DeWitt Willcox Smith. Jessie attended private elementary schools. At the age of sixteen she was sent to Cincinnati, Ohio to live with her cousins and finish her education. She trained to be a teacher and taught kindergarten in 1883. However, Smith found that the physical demands of working with children were too strenuous for her. Due to back problems, she had difficulty bending down to their level. Persuaded to attend one of her friend's or cousin's art classes, Smith realized she had a talent for drawing.

Smith was born on September 25, 1968 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr., a U.S. Air Force veteran and refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen.

Julia Murdock Smith Dixon Middleton (May 1, 1831 – September 12, 1880) was an early member of the Latter Day Saint movement and the eldest surviving child and only daughter of Joseph Smith and Emma Hale Smith. She was adopted by the Smiths. Her birth mother died giving birth to Julia and her twin brother Joseph, so their birth father John Murdock offered them to Smith and his wife, who themselves had lost prematurely born twins the same day. After Joseph and Emma Smith had taken custody of the children, in late March 1832, the infant Joseph became ill. Consequently Emma decided to have the babies sleep separately to prevent a spread of the disease. Joseph Smith had taken baby Joseph to bed with him and Emma was in the other room with Julia. That night a mob came and stormed the Smith home. In the midst of the panic, baby Joseph was exposed to the cold air and died several days later.

Friday the 13th is a 2009 American slasher film directed by Marcus Nispel and written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift from a screen story by Shannon, Swift and Mark Wheaton. It is a reboot of the Friday the 13th film series, which began in 1980. Nispel also directed the 2003 remake of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre( 1974), while Shannon and Swift wrote the screenplay for the 2003 crossover Freddy vs. Jason. The film was produced by Platinum Dunes and Crystal Lake Entertainment and distributed by New Line Cinema and Paramount Pictures.

The film was originally conceived as an origin story, but the project evolved into a re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes.  Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.  Friday the 13th was theatrically released in the United States on February 13, 2009, by New Line Cinema in North American territories and by Paramount Pictures internationally. The film had grossed over$ 92.7 million at the box office on a budget of$ 19 million, becoming the first highest- grosssing film in the franchise.

278,"Children Underground is an American 2001 documentary film directed by Edet Belzberg. In an effort to increase the Romanian work force, former communist leader Nicolae Ceauescu outlawed contraception and abortion in 1966. Thousands of unwanted children were placed in state orphanages where they faced terrible conditions. With the fall of Communism, many children from the orphanages moved into the streets while others were runaways from impoverished families. Today there are 20,000 children living in the streets while the resources for sheltering these homeless youths are severely limited.  Children Underground follows the story of five street children, aged eight to sixteen who live in a subway station in Bucharest, Romania. The street kids are encountered daily by commuting adults, who pass them by in the station as they starve, swindle, and steal, all while searching desperately for a fresh can of paint to get high with. Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintain their distance as the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, watching dispassionately as the youngsters inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags. In a slightly uplifting coda, Belzberg and crew return a year later to find that a police who swept off the Victoriei has dispersed the children. Some of them landed in state- funded homes, while others simply moved on to one of the many abandoned construction sites that dot the city. Belzberg steers away from any discussion of the rampant sexual exploitation of these young children or the fact that one of the biggest dangers they face are STDs, including AIDS, but the urban hell she presents is shattering enough. Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants in the world's wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate. One of the children director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu. At first, this child looked like a young man, but one later finds out that girls have to become tough and look boyish in order to survive. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta' Macarena' Rosu, who is also a girl. The nickname' Macarena' derives from the song Macarena, her favorite. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled. The film explores the lives of these children, who are shown fighting, abusing themselves, and becoming addicted to Aurolac. The filmmakers follow Mihai to his family's home in the town of Constana. A similar scene films Ana and Marian as they visit their home, which is also outside Bucharest.

The Lee Stone-produced song is the final piece to Pharoahe's bullet trilogy in which he anthropomorphizes a slug fired with the intent to annihilate, and tackles the issue of gun violence. The song and its provide a chilling reminder that bullets have no name.

Rape is the fourth track on Internal Affairs, the debut album of Queens rapper Pharoahe Monch. Allmusic critic Steve Huey says in his review Monch lives up to his reputation as one of hip-hop's most technically skilled MCs. Nowhere is this balancing act more evident than on Rape, a rather disquieting extended metaphor for his mastery of hip-hop (other MCs just ain't fuckin' it right Primarily, the song is a satirical response to rapper Common's classic I Used to Love H.E.R., a nostalgic song that features a feminized personification of hip-hop as a lost love that has fallen to vice. Pharoahe Monch's more graphic and violent rendition is accordingly a critique of the vapid state of contemporary mainstream hip-hop, conveyed from the perspective of a variously passionate or obsessed rapist, equally infatuated by hip-hop as a woman. As Huey points out, Rape equally is an extended metaphor for Pharoahe's technical mastery of hip-hop. Personification and extended metaphor are techniques widely employed by hip-hop lyricists. In fact this very song is developed from a theme that is found in a Pharoahe Monch verse five years earlier.  Thirteen, a song from the 1994 Organized Konfusion album , contains the following excerpt from Pharoahe's verse:

284,"My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 American independent adventure drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant, loosely based on Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 Henry IV, Part 2, and Henry V, and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel City of Night and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf.  My Own Private Idaho had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly. The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics.  My Own Private Idaho is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking. Since its 1991 release, the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a cult classic, especially among LGBT audiences. The film is notable for its then- taboo subject matter and avant- garde style.

Over the course of their career they did extensive roadwork, touring North America and Europe with bands such as Sparta, Mudhoney, Run Run Run, Division of Laura Lee, and, often, the Murder City Devils. Waude and Swenson left the band in 2001 for other projects, and the Catheters continued as a 4- piece with longtime roadie Leo Gebhardt joining as bassist. In 2002, with the help of a popular music video, they scored an indie hit with the song Nothing, from their album Static Delusions and Stone- Still Days( Sub Pop, 2002). After releasing more singles and touring heavily in 2002 and 2003, the band released the acclaimed album Howling ... It Grows and Grows !!!

In 2010, the duo began working on an album together and brought along three Fates Warning members to the fold. The five members would in turn release their debut album Sympathetic Resonance in 2011, under the name Arch/Matheos. The album, while only 6 tracks, clocked at 55 minutes.

288,"Conan the Adventurer is an American-French-Canadian animated television series adaptation of Conan the Barbarian, the literary character created by Robert E. Howard in the 1930s. Produced by Jetlag Productions and Sunbow Productions, the series debuted on September 13, 1992, ran for 65 episodes and concluded on November 22, 1993. The series was developed by Christy Marx who served as the sole story editor. The series was produced in association with Graz Entertainment for the first 13-episode season; AB Productions and Jean Chalopin's Créativité et Développement for the remaining episodes. The series also spawned a small toyline in 1992 created by Hasbro. This first incarnation of Conan in cartoon form performed much better than its follow-up cartoon, Conan and the Young Warriors, which lasted only 13 episodes.

Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 – June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Howard was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. A bookish and intellectual child, he was also a fan of boxing and spent some time in his late teens bodybuilding, eventually taking up amateur boxing. From the age of nine he dreamed of becoming a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard's writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death. Although a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard's stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was Weird Tales, where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly-read author, with his best works still reprinted. Howard's suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis his entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was not expected to wake, he walked out to his car and shot himself in the head.

Conan Christopher O'Brien (born April 18, 1963) is an American television host, comedian, writer, podcaster, and producer. He is best known for hosting several late-night talk shows; since 2010, he has hosted Conan on the cable channel TBS. Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, O'Brien was raised in an Irish Catholic family. He served as president of The Harvard Lampoon while attending Harvard University, and was a writer for the sketch comedy series  Not Necessarily the News. After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of Saturday Night Live. O'Brien was a writer and producer for The Simpsons for two seasons until he was commissioned by NBC to take over David Letterman's position as host of Late Night in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial Late Night tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien relocated from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of The Tonight Show for seven months until network politics prompted a host change in 2010. Known for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as awkward, self-deprecating humor, O'Brien's late-night programs combine the lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes). He has hosted Conan since 2010 and has also hosted such events as the Emmy Awards and Christmas in Washington. O'Brien has been the subject of a documentary, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop (2011), and has also hosted a 32-city live comedy tour and later an 18-city live comedy tour. With the retirement of David Letterman on May 20, 2015, O'Brien became the longest-working of all current late-night talk show hosts in the United States, at 25 years.

290,"The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1956 American suspense thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, starring James Stewart and Doris Day. The film is Hitchcock's second film using this title following his own 1934 film of the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. In the book- length interview Hitchcock/ Truffaut( 1967), in response to fellow filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional. The film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Que Sera, Sera( Whatever Will Be, Will Be), sung by Doris Day. It premiered at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival on April 29.

The Girl Who Knew Too Much is a 1969 neo noir film starring Adam West as Johnny Cain, a nightclub owner and former freelance adventurer who is forced out of retirement when a crime syndicate boss is murdered in his nightclub and investigations lead into unexpected areas. It was the final film of director Francis D. Lyon and United Pictures Corporation. The film co-stars Nancy Kwan, Nehemiah Persoff, Robert Alda, Patricia Smith, David Brian, and noted jazz musician Buddy Greco as nightclub entertainer Albert Lucky Jones. The melodramatic promotional tagline of The Girl Who Knew Too Much was: You have to be crazy or in love — to take on the syndicate! The film was intended to be a vehicle for Adam West to escape his Batman stereotype by playing a cynical, hard- edged tough guy. The movie's dialogue is typified by a scene between West's Cain and the boozy Mrs. Grinaldi played by Smith: The Girl Who Knew Too Much was not a box office success in theatrical release, but became a staple of late- night showings on WCBS- TV and other television stations in the early 1970s. It then disappeared from sight for decades and was in danger of becoming a lost film. However, it finally appeared in a home video release that came on May 28, 2013, on Blu-ray and DVD.

The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1934 British thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, featuring Peter Lorre, and released by Gaumont British. It was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of Hitchcock's British period. The film is Hitchcock's first film using this title and was followed later with his own 1956 film using the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book- length interview Hitchcock/ Truffaut( 1967), in response to filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional. However, it's been claimed this statement can not be taken at face value. The 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with G. K. Chesterton's 1922 book of detective stories of the same name. Hitchcock decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the stories in the book.

Man on Wire is a 2008 British- American biographical documentary film directed by James Marsh. The film chronicles Philippe Petit's 1974 high- wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center.

The title of the film is taken from the police report that led to the arrest( and later release) of Petit, whose performance had lasted for almost one hour. The film is crafted like a heist film, presenting rare footage of the preparations for the event and still photographs of the walk, alongside re-enactments( with Paul McGill as the young Petit) and present- day interviews with the participants, including Barry Greenhouse, an insurance executive who served as the inside man.  Man on Wire competed in the World Cinema Documentary Competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize: World Cinema Documentary and the World Cinema Audience Award: Documentary.

Debi Enker in Australian Cinema comments: The FJ Holden presents the suburbs as a cultural and spiritual desert. It is a place where regular bouts with the bottle are the only antidote for lives without hope or direction. The film initially received a R classification from the Australian Film Board of Review, but after an appeal to the censors it was revised to a M classification for moderate sex scenes and moderate coarse language. However, all states except Victoria and New South Wales exercised their right to override the Commonwealth decision and retained the R classification.

Holden Caulfield, a teenager from New York City, is living in an unspecified institution in southern California near Hollywood in 1951.

The Holden FJ series is a range of motor vehicles which was produced in Australia by Holden from 1953 to 1956. The FJ was the second model of an all Australian car manufactured by Holden and was based upon the established 48- 215 series, commonly referred to as the FX. The sedan, in Standard, Business and Special trim levels, and a coupe utility were announced in October 1953 and were followed by a Panel van derivative in December of that year. A wagon prototype was built but the bodystyle was not put into production. In 1954, Holden's first exports began with sales of the FJ in New Zealand. The FJ, of monocoque construction, broadly followed the silhouette of its predecessor, but featured a bolder horizontal styled front grille, along with comfort and decoration upgrades in a new sedan model named the' Holden Special'. Originally specified as achieved at 3,800 rpm, the claimed maximum power output from the six- cylinder engine was increased to achieved at 4,000 rpm. In 1955 the car underwent a mild interior facelift for the Holden Special sedan, along with a variation in paint and trim options. The FJ series was progressively replaced by models from the Holden FE series from July 1956 to May 1957 with a total of 169,969 examples produced. There are nearly 20 specific FX- FJ Holden Car Clubs of Australia with members committed to preserving them. These clubs organise a national gathering for FX- FJ Holden enthusiasts every second year.

Ashanti (also called Ashanti, Land of No Mercy) is a 1979 action adventure film, produced by Georges-Alain Vuille, and directed by Richard Fleischer. Despite its impressive cast and setting (on location in the Sahara, and in Kenya, Israel, and Sicily), it was widely panned by critics upon release. Michael Caine was reportedly very disappointed with the project and claims it was the third worst film along with his previous films The Magus and The Swarm (despite appearing in other failures in the 1980s), after director Fleischer and co-star Beverly Johnson were both removed from filming two-thirds of the way through the shoot. Fleischer departed after being hospitalised with sunstroke. However, an interview with Ms. Johnson included on the 2013 Severin Films Blu-ray edition of Ashanti makes no reference to these removals, suggesting that they may belong to myth. This is one of William Holden's final films. Both Fleischer and cinematographer Tonti had previously worked together on Barabbas (1961).

I've always started Lydia records from scratch and by myself. Matt and I started sending The Cinema songs back and forth, coast to coast, really kind of calling each other out to keep making the songs better and surpassing the previous versions. I think that the fact that we are both stubborn and pretty damn picky, if we're being honest here, is really what made the songs and album what they are today. I think fans of the band can expect much more music to come from The Cinema. The Cinema released the official track listing for their debut album on September 11, 2011.

Which country Anthemiolus's father is from?",germany,roman empire,0.23592700064182281,0.0,False
301,"Anthemiolus (died c. 471 AD) was the son of the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius (467–472) and Marcia Euphemia, daughter of the Eastern Roman emperor Marcian. His name means little Anthemius and is a diminutive of his and his father's name Anthemius, in order to distinguish them both. His life is known only from the Chronica Gallica of 511. He was sent by his father to Gaul with a powerful army, accompanied by three generals — Thorisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus — in order to oppose the Visigoths then occupying Provence and threatening to conquer the Auvergne. He and his generals were defeated by the Visigothic king Euric near Arles and all four of them lost their lives. The Chronica, in entry 649, states: Antimolus a patre Anthemio imperatore cum Thorisario, Everdingo et Hermiano com. stabuli Arelate directus est, quibus rex Euricus trans Rhodanum occurrit occisisque ducibus omnia vastavit Antimolus was sent by his father, Emperor Anthemius, to Arles, with Thorisarius, Everdingus and Hermanius, comes [or comitesstabuli: King Euric met them on the far side of the Rhone and, having killed the duces, laid everything waste. According to the Chronica, this event falls between the succession of Euric (467) and the war between Anthemius and Ricimer (471–472). It can probably be further narrowed to the period when Anthemius is known to have been organising a concerted effort to remove the Visigoths from Gaul between 468 and 471, a period during which an army led by the Briton Riothamus was defeated near Déols. It is not impossible that Anthemiolus' army was sent to reinforce Riothamus and that Euric defeated both forces in turn, probably in either 470 or 471.

During the 1970s, Jennings was instrumental in the inception of outlaw country and with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter recorded country music's first platinum album, Wanted!

Jennings is active mainly in outlaw country and Southern rock genres. Jennings is the son of country music legends Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter.

His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. “I love my mom,” says Jennings, “ but I like Dad ’s version better. And I believe it’s true. He didn’t make [stuff] like that up.” Currently signed to Universal South, Jennings made his debut with the single 4th Of July of his 2005 album Put the O Back in Country, which peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard country charts. Jennings has since followed with six more full-length studio albums: Electric Rodeo (2006), The Wolf (2007), Black Ribbons (2009), Family Man (2012), The Other Life (2013) and Countach (For Giorgio) (2016), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous EPs.

Princess Li Jingshou () (died 437?) was a princess of the Chinese/Xiongnu state Northern Liang. Her husband was Juqu Mujian (Prince Ai). Li Jingshou was the daughter of the Western Liang prince Li Gao and Lady Yin, who was later princess dowager when Li Jingshou's brother Li Xin became prince in 417. When he was subsequently defeated and killed in 420 by the Northern Liang prince Juqu Mengxun, the Western Liang capital Jiuquan (, in modern Jiuquan, Gansu) fell to Northern Liang, and Princess Dowager Yin and Li Jingshou were captured. However, because Juqu Mengxun admired Princess Dowager Yin's courage (in refusing to plead for her life), he treated her with respect, and married Li Jingshou to his son Juqu Mujian. In 433, with Juqu Mengxun extremely ill, the Northern Liang nobles, believing Juqu Mengxun's younger brother Juqu Puti (), whom Juqu Mengxun had designed heir apparent, to be too young to govern, deposed Juqu Puti and made Juqu Mujian heir apparent instead. Apparently, after Juqu Mengxun soon died and was succeeded by Juqu Mujian, Li Jingshou was created princess. However, in 437, Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei, to whose state Northern Liang submitted as a vassal, wanted to marry his sister Princess Wuwei to Juqu Mujian. Juqu Mujian was therefore forced to divorce Princess Li, and she and her mother Princess Dowager Yin were relocated from the Northern Liang capital Guzang (, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) to Jiuquan. Princess Li soon died.

She is not to be confused with the still more famous Yang Guifei or Consort Yang of the Tang dynasty. She was approximately fifteen to seventeen years older than the emperor. Lady Wan had been a mother figure to young Chenghua, but Chenghua Emperor's feeling for her slowly transitioned from mother's love to romantic. Eventually she gave birth to a boy but he died at age of ten months old. Consort Wan was deeply loved by Emperor, who regularly gave her a lot of presents. These signs of affection caused a lot of jealousy from other consorts who began spreading rumors about Consort Wan's evil doings.

Emperor Xuan of (Western) Liang ((); 519–562), personal name Xiao Cha (), courtesy name Lisun (), was the founding emperor of the Chinese Western Liang dynasty. He took the Liang throne under support from Western Wei after Western Wei forces had defeated and killed his uncle Emperor Yuan in 554, but many traditional historians, because he controlled little territory and relied heavily on military support by Western Wei and Western Wei's successor state Northern Zhou, did not consider him and his successors true emperors of Liang. Instead, their state is traditionally considered separate, as Western Liang (or Later Liang).

Charles, Prince of Wales (Charles Philip Arthur George; born 14 November 1948) is the heir apparent to the British throne as the eldest son of Elizabeth II. He has been Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay since 1952, and he is the oldest and longest-serving heir apparent in British history. He is also the longest-serving Prince of Wales, having held that title since 1958. Charles was born at Buckingham Palace as the first grandchild of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He was educated at Cheam and Gordonstoun schools, which his father, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, had attended as a child. Charles also spent a year at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge, Charles served in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976.

Charles, Duke of Calabria (1298 – 9 November 1328) was the son of King Robert of Naples and Yolanda of Aragon. Charles was born in Naples in 1298, during the reign of his paternal grandfather King Charles II, the second king of the angevin dynasty that ruled Naples since 1266. Charles was the son of the King's third son Prince Robert and his consort Yolanda of Aragon. Little is known of his early life, so one can assume that he spent his early years at the court of his grandfather. In 1309, Charles' grandfather died and his father became King Robert the Wise. It was then that he became Duke of Calabria and was created Vicar-General of the Kingdom of Sicily (Naples). His father intended him to lead the force sent to aid Florence in 1315, but was constrained by time to send Robert's brother, Philip I of Taranto, instead. The Florentine-Neapolitan coalition was badly beaten at the ensuing Battle of Montecatini. The victory of Castruccio Castracani at Altopascio in 1325 led the Florentines to elect Charles signore (lord) of the city for ten years in 1326. At the time, he was unsuccessfully attempting to seize Sicily from his first cousin Frederick III, and sent Walter VI of Brienne as his deputy until he could arrive, where Walter made a (misleadingly) favorable impression. While Charles' arrival checked Castruccio, he exacted onerous taxes from the Florentines, until he was recalled to Naples in December 1327 due to the advance of Emperor Louis IV into Italy. There he died in 1328. He left as heir his eldest surviving daughter, Joanna ; a posthumous daughter, Marie, was born in 1329. Charles was buried in the church of Santa Chiara in Naples.

319,"Ælfwynn was the ruler of Mercia for a few months in 918, following her mother's death on 12 June 918. She was the daughter of Æthelred, ruler of English Mercia, and Æthelflæd( styled The Lady of Mercia). The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle states that she was deprived of all control in Mercia, and was led into Wessex three weeks before Christmas. Her accession was the only example of rule passing from one woman to another in the early medieval period in the British Isles.

Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians (870 – 12 June 918) ruled Mercia in the English Midlands from 911 until her death. She was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great, king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith. Æthelflæd was born around 870 at the height of the Viking invasions of England. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule – East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered, and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings – but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people not living in areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying Æthelflæd to Æthelred. Æthelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with Æthelflæd's brother, the future King Edward the Elder. Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified Worcester, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built a new minster in Gloucester. Æthelred's health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that Æthelflæd was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern Danelaw. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint, Oswald, which were translated to the new Gloucester minster. Æthelred died in 911 and Æthelflæd then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as one of the most unique events in early medieval history. Alfred had built a network of fortified burhs and in the 910s Edward and Æthelflæd embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were Wednesbury, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as her greatest triumph. In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. Æthelflæd was succeeded by her daughter Ælfwynn, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried Ælfwynn off to Wessex. Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under Æthelred and Æthelflæd but they agree that Æthelflæd was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury, who described her as a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul. According to Pauline Stafford, like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages. In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.

Raymundo Gleyzer( September 25, 1941, Buenos Aires- missing since May 27, 1976) was an Argentine political filmmaker. He specialized in documentaries. He was disappeared as an opponent of the military dictatorship, and most likely murdered. Born into a Jewish family, Gleyzer became interested in politics and film early on. All his films he put into the service of the fight against social injustice and for the revolution. He made his first film in the backward northeast of Brazil, where he barely escaped imminent death. In the early 1970s he made a film in Mexico about the so- called institutionalized revolution of the PRI ruling party.

His last major film, Los traidores( The Traitors), presents his critique of the Peronist political movement, which played an important role in Argentina in 1973.

Anastasia is a 1956 American historical drama film directed by Anatole Litvak and written by Arthur Laurents. Set in interwar France, the film follows the story of a suicidal amnesiac( Ingrid Bergman), whose remarkable resemblance to the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia — the youngest daughter of the late Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, who is rumored to have survived the execution of her family — draws her into a plot devised by the former Russian White General Bounine( Yul Brynner) and his associates to swindle from the Grand Duchess an inheritance of £ 10 million. However, the ultimate hurdle to their plan is the exiled Russian aristocracy — in particular the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna( Helen Hayes) — whom their handpicked claimant must convince of her legitimacy if they wish for their scheme to succeed. The origins of Anastasia lie in a play written by Marcelle Maurette, which was in turn inspired by Anna Anderson, the most famous of the many Anastasia impostors who appeared after the death of the Imperial family in July 1918.

William IV (William Alexander; French: Guillaume Alexandre; 22 April 1852 – 25 February 1912) reigned as the Grand Duke of Luxembourg from 17 November 1905 until his death. He succeeded his father, Adolphe. William was a Protestant, the religion of the House of Nassau. He married Princess Marie Anne of Portugal, believing that a Roman Catholic country ought to have a Roman Catholic monarch. Thus his heirs have been Catholic. At the death of his uncle, Prince Nikolaus-Wilhelm in 1905, the only other legitimate male in the House of Nassau-Weilburg was William's cousin, Georg Nikolaus, Count of Merenberg, the product of a morganatic marriage. So in 1907, William declared the Counts of Merenberg non-dynastic, naming his own eldest daughter Marie-Adélaïde (1894–1924) as heir presumptive to the grand ducal throne. She became Luxembourg's first reigning grand duchess upon her father's death in 1912, and upon her own abdication in 1919, was succeeded by her younger sister Charlotte (1896–1985).

Because his father’s marriage to his mother was morganatic, Frederick was not counted as a member of the House of Hohenzollern. After the death of his mother, Frederick was, together with his older brother, William, heir to the Schloss Albrechtsberg in Dresden, which he occupied until his death. In 1901, together with Friedrich Botho, a brother of Philip, Prince of Eulenburg, he had to leave the Prussian military service because of his homosexual inclinations.

Aldo Weber Vieira da Rosa( November 15, 1917 – June 8, 2015) was a Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. His research interests were in ionospheric processes, energy processes and renewable energy. He is the author of Fundamentals of Renewable Energy Processes and Fundamentals of Electronics. He is also the holder of a US patent on the process for the production of ammonia. Da Rosa was born in Florianópolis, Brazil. After graduating from the Brazilian Military Academy and the both in Rio de Janeiro, he entered the Brazilian Air Force. In the early 1940s he was stationed in the US as part of a cooperative military program, and during this time he was relocated from Washington, D.C., to the Alameda Naval Air Station in the San Francisco Bay Area. This gave him the opportunity to attend Stanford for the first time and to study electrical engineering. Although he did not have an undergraduate degree, his technical experience enabled him to be admitted into the graduate program. He completed an Electrical Engineer ’s( EE) degree and around the same time, in 1944, he married fellow Stanford student Aili Ranta( M.S., 1943) and moved to Harvard University. In 1945 Aldo moved back to Brazil with his new wife. For the next twenty years Aldo was extraordinarily active in what we now refer to as aerospace activities in Brazil, while still attached to the Brazilian Air Force. From 1945 to 1951 he founded and was the first head of the Research and Standardization division of the Diretoria de Rotas Aéreas( the Brazilian FAA). Then, from 1952 to 1953 he was Associate Professor of Electronics at ITA, an engineering college in São José dos Campos. In 1954 he founded and was the first director of the Instituto de Pesquinas e Desenvolvimento( IPD) and in 1956 he became chairman of the Brazilian National Research Council. He resigned from this council following a serious injury to his leg during an international glider competition in France. From 1961 to 1963 he founded and was first chairman of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias, the Brazilian equivalent of NASA.

Da Rosa retired from the Brazilian Air Force as Brigadier General in 1965 and completed his Stanford Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1966 under Professor( and later astronaut) Owen K. Garriott. His research involved the first full- physics model of the electron distribution in the ionosphere including thermal processes to describe the electron and ion temperatures. This model predicted the total electron content( TEC) of the ionosphere that was first measured at Stanford University using radio signals from the Soviet Union ’s Sputnik, a particularly important topic at the time given the developing competition in space between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Appointed a Research Associate in 1966, and then a Senior Research Associate( 1969 – 1980), Aldo became a Professor( Research) in Electrical Engineering in 1980. During this time, his interests gradually turned more to the fundamentals of energy processes and renewable energy. His classes on renewable energy were greatly appreciated by the students and he continued teaching these energy classes until 2011, well after his retirement and conversion to Professor( Emeritus) in 1983. An active Masters Swimmer, da Rosa broke 99 National Records and 37 World Records. He currently still holds the world records in the 85- 89 age group in the 200 meter IM and 200 meter breast stroke. He was inducted into the International Masters Swimming Hall of Fame in 2004. In March 2010, da Rosa was awarded the Grã- Cruz da Ordem Nacional do Mérito Científico, an honor bestowed by the President of Brazil upon Brazilian and foreign personalities recognized for their scientific and technical contributions to the cause and development of science in Brazil. Da Rosa attracted large numbers of students to his renewable energy classes at Stanford.

Spirit Unforgettable is a Canadian documentary film, which premiered at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in 2016. Directed by Pete McCormack, the film profiles the Canadian folk rock band Spirit of the West in preparation for a 2015 concert at Massey Hall, as part of their farewell tour following lead singer John Mann's diagnosis with early- onset Alzheimer's disease. At the time of the Massey Hall concert, it was possible but not definitive that due to Mann's cognitive decline, the show may have become the band's last- ever concert performance. The band did, however, ultimately perform a few more times following the show, most notably for a three- night series of finale performances at Vancouver's Commodore Ballroom in April 2016. The film also includes Mann's wife Jill Daum, an actress and playwright who has written her own theatrical play about Alzheimer's, Forget About Tomorrow. Musician Paul Hyde also contributes to the film's soundtrack, performing a rendition of his song, I Miss My Mind the Most. McCormack, a longtime friend of the band, invested$ 100,000 of his own money in the film up front, telling The Globe and Mail that I had to go and dive in right away … funding or no funding, because of the disease. The film did later secure funding, including a completion grant from the Shaw Media/ Hot Docs Fund. Many critics have singled out the band's live performance of their signature song Home for a Rest near the end of the film, which saw the entire audience begin to sing along the moment Mann had a slip in remembering the lyrics, as its life- affirming emotional climax. The film aired on HBO Canada on July 1, 2016.

He married: 1) Margaret O'Brien, daughter of Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond and Eleanor FitzGerald, before 6 October 1548; 2) Margaret O'Brien, daughter of Donough O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Thomond and Helen Butler, on 24 November 1553; and 3) Julia MacCarthy, daughter of Cormac 'Oge' MacCarthy, in 1568. He and his first wife, Margaret O'Brien (daughter of Murrough) were divorced after he claimed that she worked witchcraft against him. As a result of his father's multiple marriages and relationships there were a number of candidates contending for title Earl of Clanricarde. Richard, the oldest legitimate son, was the eventual successor. He was sporadically opposed by his brothers and half-brothers, including John, who claimed the title in 1568. Richard extended his influence at the expense of the O'Kelly's and the O'Madden's in the east of County Galway, overlordship over the O'Shaughnessey in the south, while allying himself with the O'Conor Don and the O'Brien of Thomond.

John II died in 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein (now part of Koblenz), after a tenure of 46 years, 7 months and 18 days, the longest of any bishop of Trier. He was buried in the Cathedral of Trier in a magnificent grave that he had built during his lifetime.

Where did Meritaten's father die?",akhetaten,akhetaten,1.0,1.0,True
353,"Meritaten Tasherit, which means Meritaten the Younger was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty. Her name means She who is beloved of Aten; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped. She held several titles, performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare, who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten. Meritaten also may have served as pharaoh in her own right under the name, Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten.

Meritites I was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 4th dynasty. Her name means Beloved of her Father. Several of her titles are known from a stela found at Giza. She was buried in the middle Queen’s Pyramid in Giza (Pyramid G 1b). Meritites was a daughter of King Sneferu and his consort of unknown name. Meritites married her (half?)brother, King Khufu. With Khufu, she was the mother of the Crown Prince Kawab, and possibly Djedefre. Both Queen Hetepheres II and Pharaoh Khafra have been suggested as children of Meretites I and Khufu as well, and it is possible that Meritites II was a daughter of Meritites I as well. Auguste Mariette recorded a stela at Giza in which Meritites is said to be a favorite of both Sneferu and Khufu: King’s wife, his beloved, devoted to Horus, Mertitytes. King’s wife, his beloved, Mertitytes; beloved of the Favorite of the Two Goddesses; she who says anything whatsoever and it is done for her. Great in the favor of Snefr[u]; great in the favor of Khuf[u], devoted to Horus, honored under Khafre. Merti[tyt]es. [Breasted] Meritites held the titles: great one of the hetes-sceptre of Khufuwrt-hetes-nt-khwfw), great one of the hetes-sceptre of Snofru (wrt-hetes-nt-snfrw), king’s wife, his beloved (hmt-nisw meryt.f), attendant of Horus (kht-hrw) and consort and beloved of the Two Ladiessm3yt-mry-nbty).

Meritites II( Merytiotes, Meritetes) or Meritites A( beloved of her father) was a 4th dynasty Princess of Ancient Egypt, and probably a daughter of King Khufu. She may have been a daughter of Meritites I based on the fact that this queen is mentioned in mastaba G 7650. She married the Director of the Palace Akhethotep( a non-royal court official) and she had several children with her husband. Meritites and her husband shared a mastaba( G 7650) in Giza.

Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit are two small princesses who appear in scenes dating to the later part of the reign of Akhenaten.

The inscription is damaged and the name of the mother and grandmother of the princesses has not been preserved.

Eleanor of England (18 June 1269 – 29 August 1298) was an English princess, the eldest surviving daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen Eleanor of Castile.

She was also close to her sickly brother Henry. On one Pentecost Eve, Henry and Eleanor were given two partridges for their dinner, for a special treat. For a long period Eleanor was betrothed to King Alfonso III of Aragon. Alfonso's parents were under papal interdict, however, because of their claims to the throne of Sicily, which were contrary to the papal donation of the Sicilian throne to Charles I of Naples, and despite the Aragonese ruler's repeated pleas that Edward I send his daughter to them for marriage, Edward refused to send her as long as the interdict remained in place. In 1282 he declined one such request by saying that his wife and mother felt the girl, who had just turned 13, was too young to be married, and that they wanted to wait another two years before sending her to Aragon. Alfonso died before the marriage could take place. Eleanor subsequently married the French nobleman, Henry III, Count of Bar on September 20, 1293, and had two children: According to Kenneth Panton, Eleanor is credited with a daughter called Eleanor (b.1285), who supposedly married a Welshman named Llywelyn ap Owain. She died at Ghent on 29 August 1298. Eleanor was buried in Westminster Abbey but the location of her grave in the Abbey is unknown.

Bucquet and starring Lew Ayres as Dr. James Kildare, an idealistic, freshly graduated medical intern, who benefits greatly from the wise counsel of his experienced mentor, Dr. Leonard Gillespie (played by Lionel Barrymore).

Young Doctor Kildare introduced the regulars working at Blair, including hospital administrator Dr. Carew (Walter Kingsford), nurses Molly Byrd (Alma Kruger) and Nosey Parker (Nell Craig), orderly Conover (George H. Reed), ambulance attendant Joe Wayman (Nat Pendleton), switchboard operator Sally (Marie Blake), and Mike Ryan (Frank Orth), proprietor of Sullivan's Hospital Cafe.

Catherine of Guelders was the fourth and youngest child of Arnold, Duke of Guelders( 1410- 1473) and Catherine of Cleves( 1417 – 1479).< br> Until 1477, she led an inconspicuous life, in the shadow of her brother Adolf, at war with his father, and her sisters Mary, married to King James II of Scotland and Margaret, married to Frederick I, Count Palatine of Simmern .<br> Despite efforts by her father, no suitable husband was found for Catherine .< br> 17th century theories that she was secretly married with Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège, are now believed to be false. Everything changed for Catherine in 1477, when Charles the Bold was killed in the Battle of Nancy. Guelders had been under control of Charles the Bold since 1473, and now saw the chance to regain its independence. As her brother Adolf was in Flanders, the States of Guelders convinced him to appoint his sister Catherine as regent, pending his return. Catherine reluctantly agreed. But the regency lasted much longer than expected because Adolf was killed in battle on June 27, 1477. She then continued to rule as regent for his son Charles II, who was held with his sister Philippa by the Burgundians. Catherine became involved in the Guelderian War of Independence with Maximilian of Austria. In 1482, she was forced to conclude peace with Maximilian and to retire from politics. In 1492, she witnessed the regained independence of Guelders under her nephew Charles II, Duke of Guelders .< br> Catherine died in 1497 and was buried in the church of Geldern, where her grave can still be seen.

Who is the father of the composer of song I Miss You (Miley Cyrus Song)?",billy ray cyrus,billy ray cyrus,1.0000001192092896,1.0000000000000002,True
377,"I Miss You is a song by American recording artist, Miley Cyrus. It was co-written by Cyrus (credited under her birth name Destiny Hope Cyrus), Brian Green, Wendy Foy Green, and produced by Brian Green. I Miss You is an homage to Cyrus' late grandfather, Ron Cyrus, who died on February 28, 2006. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, and, seeing her grandfather nearing death, Cyrus wanted to write him a song prior to his death. It was released to Radio Disney mid-year 2007 as promotion for the dual disc . The song is a ballad with rock and country influences. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics; some commented on how it deviated from her usual material at the time and how effective the message was. I Miss You appeared on two United States charts: it peaked at number nine on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, an extension of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and at number ninety-two on the defunct Pop 100. Cyrus performed the song on acoustic guitar as an encore at several stops on her first headlining concert tour, the Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007–08).

 I Miss You is a song by American recording artist Beyoncé, taken from her fourth studio album, 4( 2011). It was written by Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyoncé and Taylor. The song's development was motivated the fact that Beyoncé wanted to focus on songs being classics, songs that would last, and songs that she could sing when she becomes old. A mid-paced R&B ballad, I Miss You is influenced by the ballads of the 1980s. Its instrumentation consists essentially of synthesizers and keyboards.  I Miss You finds Beyoncé, as the protagonist, thinking deeply over her relationship with her love interest from whom she parted; however, she still pines for him and feels self- conscious for doing so.  I Miss You was generally praised by music critics who complimented its very sparse production as well as its aurally remarkable 1980s influence. Some of them also described the song as a haunting ballad and called it the highlight of the record. Critics also complimented how Beyoncé's vocals keep on alternating from desperate and calm throughout the song, and highlighted the vulnerability in her voice. Following the release of 4 in early July 2011, I Miss You charted at number 184 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 34 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart, based on downloads alone. The song was part of Beyoncé's set list for her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, held in Roseland Ballroom, New York City in August 2011.

 Missing You is a R&B song written and produced by Babyface, who produced the song for singer Mary J. Blige, who released it as the third United Kingdom single from her Share My World album, released in October 2, 1997. The song featured Shanice in background vocals and much like Seven Days, it talked about a woman in dilemma over a relationship with a man that she at first claimed she was n't in love with but then finds herself thinking about him all the time and her missing him. The song became a performance show- stopper for Blige on several stops of her Share My World tour and was indeed a highlight when she performed it on the Soul Train Music Awards, where she was greeted with a huge standing ovation afterwards. The song was released in the United Kingdom and eventually reached number nineteen there. The b-side to CD: 1 of the Missing You single was I Can Love You, which was not released as a stand- alone single in the United Kingdom.

I Thought I Lost You is a pop rock song performed by both American singer-songwriter and actress Miley Cyrus and actor and singer John Travolta.

It was released to Radio Disney as promotion for the 2008 Disney animated film Bolt, in which Cyrus and Travolta provide the voices of Penny and Bolt. I Thought I Lost You was made after filmmakers requested Cyrus to write a song for the film. The lyrics speak of getting lost and getting found.

 Missing You is a song by American R&B singer Case. It was produced by Tim& Bob and released in February 2001 as the lead single from the album Open Letter.

Nikolai Alekseevich Polevoy ( Russian   )  was a controversial Russian editor, writer, translator, and historian; his brother was the critic and journalist Ksenofont Polevoy and his sister the writer and publisher of folktales Ekaterina Avdeeva. Polevoy was from an old merchant family from Kursk but was born in Irkutsk, where his father was director of a Russian-American company, and lived there until 1811, when the family moved first to Moscow and then to Kursk. His father, disappointed in his refusal to take up the family business and disapproving of his interest in literature and history, refused to pay for his education, so he taught himself. In February 1820 he moved to Moscow, where he attended both the theater and lectures at Moscow University; he visited Saint Petersburg and met Alexander Griboyedov, Vasily Zhukovsky, Faddei Bulgarin, and other literary figures, and began a literary career, publishing articles, poems, and translations in the journals of the day. In 1825 he started his own journal, Moskovskii telegrafThe Moscow Telegraph), hoping to attract the writers he admired, like Pushkin, as well as emphasize the positive contributions of the merchant class to Russia. Unfortunately, the aristocrats of the Pushkin circle viewed him as a vulgar parvenu, and his attack on Karamzin's reactionary History of the Russian State offended many influential people, notably Pyotr Vyazemsky, who had been Karamzin's ward and whose sister was married to the older historian. When Polevoy wrote his own six-volume History of the Russian People (1829–1833), it was savaged by almost everyone. The brilliant and idiosyncratic critic Apollon Grigoryev wrote in his memoirs, From our present [1864] point of view it would be impossible to conceive anything more indecent than the article that the editor of the Moscow Herald [i.e., Mikhail Pogodin] hurled against The History of the Russian People, if the articles [by Nikolai Nadezhdin] against it in the old men's European Herald had not been even more indecent... The factions do not seem to have been in their right minds thirty years ago. What was the cause of their being so hostile that they foamed at the mouth? Polevoy emphasized that history followed laws and did not depend on the actions of particular individuals; he also was one of the first to present Russian history as a confrontation between Europe and Asia. Lauren G. Leighton says, summing up the contributions of Nikolai and his brother and collaborator Ksenofont:No one should argue that the Polevoys were comparable in literary taste and talent to the aristocrats of the Pushkin pleiad; their self-educated, self-made characters are apparent in their journal. But neither should they be denied their great contribution in making leading European thinkers available to the Russian public in Russian, their eminently human liberalism, or their courage in constantly testing—and outwitting—the government censor. In 1834, after competition from both the aristocrats and the plebeians had laid waste to the Polevoys' finances, The Moscow Telegraph was closed down by the government. The Polevoys spent most of the rest of their lives editing the journals of Bulgarin and Grech. The journal was closed down because of a bad review it gave a play by Nestor Kukolnik; Bernard Pares tells the story:It must be understood that the vast distances and the thinness of population in Russia practically confined journalistic enterprise to St. Petersburg and Moscow. Even the Moscow journalists were hampered, in comparison with those of St. Petersburg, because it took them longer to guess in which direction the wind of the moment was blowing. Thus in 1834 Polevóy, who had severely reviewed a patriotic play, found, on his arrival in St. Petersburg, that it had pleased the upper society. What are you doing? said his protector, the Administrator of Police; you see how they take the play here; you will have to agree with this opinion, or else you will get yourself into terrible trouble. D. S. Mirsky writes, But his memory after his death was deservedly reverenced by the new intelligentsia as that of a pioneer and, in a sense, a martyr.

386,"Herman Friedrich Graebe or Gräbe,( June 19, 1900 – April 17, 1986) was a German manager and engineer in charge of a German building firm in Ukraine, who witnessed mass executions of the Jews of Dubno on October 5, 1942 by Nazis. Following the war he wrote a famous and horrifying testimony. Graebe gave the following eyewitness account: My foreman and I went directly to the pits. Nobody bothered us. Now I heard rifle shots in quick succession from behind one of the earth mounds. The people who had got off the trucks- men, women and children of all ages- had to undress upon the order of an SS man who carried a riding or dog whip. They had to put down their clothes in fixed places, sorted according to shoes, top clothing and undergarments. I saw heaps of shoes of about 800 to 1000 pairs, great piles of under -linen and clothing. Without screaming or weeping these people undressed, stood around in family groups, kissed each other, said farewells, and waited for a sign from another SS man, who stood near the pit, also with a whip in his hand. During the fifteen minutes I stood near, I heard no complaint or plea for mercy. I watched a family of about eight persons, a man and a woman both of about fifty, with their children of about twenty to twenty- four, and two grown- up daughters about twenty- eight or twenty- nine. An old woman with snow white hair was holding a one- year- old child in her arms and singing to it and tickling it. The child was cooing with delight. The parents were looking on with tears in their eyes. The father was holding the hand of a boy about ten years old and speaking to him softly; the boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed to the sky, stroked his head and seemed to explain something to him. At that moment the SS man at the pit started shouting something to his comrade. The latter counted off about twenty persons and instructed them to go behind the earth mound. Among them was the family I have just mentioned. I well remember a girl, slim with black hair, who, as she passed me, pointed to herself and said, twenty- three years old. I walked around the mound and found myself confronted by a tremendous grave. People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that only their heads were visible. Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads. Some of the people shot were still moving. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was nearly two- thirds full. I estimated that it already contained about a thousand people. I looked for the man who did the shooting. He was an SS man, who sat at the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet dangling into the pit. He had a tommy- gun on his knees and was smoking a cigarette. The people, completely naked, went down some steps which were cut in the clay wall of the pit and clambered over the heads of the people lying there to the place to which the SS man directed them. They lay down in front of the dead or wounded people; some caressed those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice. Then I heard a series of shots. I looked into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching or the heads lying already motionless on top of the bodies that lay beneath them. Blood was running from their necks. The next batch was approaching already. They went down into the pit, lined themselves up against the previous victims and were shot. He later provided vital testimony in the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, invoking bitter persecution from many of his countrymen. To escape the hostility, Graebe moved his family to San Francisco in 1948, where he lived until his death in 1986. Hermann Graebe was honoured as a' Righteous Among the Nations' by Yad Vashem. Another witness of the mass executions of October 1942 in Dubno was the German officer Axel von dem Bussche who, traumatised by what he had seen, in 1943 joined the German resistance around Claus von Stauffenberg and unsuccessfully tried to kill Adolf Hitler in a suicide attack in November 1943.

Philippe Le Bas (18 June 1794 in Paris – 19 May 1860 in Paris) was a French hellenist, archaeologist and translator. He was the son of Philippe Le Bas and Elisabeth Duplay, the daughter of Robespierre's landlord Maurice Duplay. He was only 6 weeks old when his father committed suicide on Robespierre's fall on 27 July 1794 in the Thermidorian Reaction.

In September 1940 the first Alsatian resistance movement led by Marcel Weinum called La main noire (The black hand) was created. It was composed by a group of 25 young men aged from 14 to 18 years old who led several attacks against the German occupation. The actions culminated with the attack of the Gauleiter Robert Wagner, the highest commander of Alsace directly under the order of Hitler. In March 1942, Marcel Weinum was prosecuted by the Gestapo and sentenced to be beheaded at the age of 18 in April 1942 in Stuttgart, Germany. His last words will be: If I have to die, I shall die but with a pure heart. From 1943 the city was bombarded by Allied aircraft. While the First World War had not notably damaged the city, Anglo-American bombing caused extensive destruction in raids of which at least one was allegedly carried out by mistake. In August 1944, several buildings in the Old Town were damaged by bombs, particularly the Palais Rohan, the Old Customs House (Ancienne Douane) and the Cathedral. On 23 November 1944, the city was officially liberated by the 2nd French Armoured Division under General Leclerc. He achieved the oath that he made with his soldiers, after the decisive Capture of Kufra. With the Oath of Kuffra, they swore to keep up the fight until the French flag flew over the Cathedral of Strasbourg.

Through his mother, Dermide was a nephew of the future Emperor Napoleon I. In 1802, during the Haitian Revolution, Dermide arrived on the island-colony of Saint-Domingue with his parents, as part of the Saint-Domingue expedition. After his father's death of yellow fever later during the year, Dermide and Pauline were brought back to France. In 1803, Pauline remarried, this time to Italian nobleman Camillo Borghese, and she took up residence, along with her husband and son, in Rome. Always a frail child, Dermide died of a fever at the age of six, three months after his uncle became Emperor and two years before his mother's proclamation as Duchess of Guastalla.

387,"James Adam (21 July 1732 – 20 October 1794) was a Scottish architect and furniture designer, but was often overshadowed by his older brother and business partner, Robert Adam. They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the Grand Tour, leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768–1772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771–5 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived — he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

Robert Adam (3 July 1728 – 3 March 1792) was a Scottish neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer. He was the son of William Adam (1689–1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the Adam Style, and his theory of movement in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses. He served as the member of Parliament for Kinross-shire from 1768 to 1774.

Katherine persuaded King Henry VI to take an interest in the boys, who were his half-brothers. Henry later ennobled them, thereby taking one of the important steps that would later enable Edmund's son Henry Tudor to claim the English throne. Edmund's wife Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry Tudor, had been a ward of Katherine's brother, William de la Pole, steward of the royal household.

Baise- moi is a 2000 French crime thriller film written and directed by Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi and starring Karen Lancaume and Raffaëla Anderson. It is based on the novel by Despentes, first published in 1993. The film received intense media coverage because of its graphic mix of violence and explicit sex scenes. Consequently, it is sometimes considered an example of the New French Extremity. As a French noun, un baiser means a kiss, but as a verb, baiser means to fuck, so Baise- moi means simply Fuck me.

In 2000, The Film Censorship Board of Malaysia banned the film outright because of very high- impact violence and sexual content throughout.

He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera. Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song (1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically-charged, blood-soaked tale of a young village girl's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality (Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture (Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and independent festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles.

The album generated both critical and commercial success, peaking at number 74 on the Billboard 200. It also contained the single Paparazzi, which peaked at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100. This success allowed Xzibit to secure a recording contract with Loud Records later that year. Xzibit released his second album 40 Dayz & 40 Nightz on August 25, 1998, which peaked at number 53 on the Billboard 200. The album also contained the single What U See Is What U Get, which peaked at #50 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's success also caught attention from West Coast rapper Dr. Dre who acted as the executive producer on Xzibit's third album Restless which was released on December 12, 2000. Restless debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, and was later certified platinum in the United States. The album also contained the singles Front 2 BackX, and Get Your Walk On. His follow-up album Man vs. Machine (2002) also enjoyed similar commercial success; it debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold, while Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004) also became certified gold. After the release of Full Circle in 2006, Xzibit underwent a musical hiatus, not releasing any music until the release of his seventh studio album Napalm on October 9, 2012. However, shortly after the release of the album, Xzibit entered another period of hiatus, and has not released any further music to date. Xzibit has also gained fame as an actor and television host, notably for his role as Shyne Johnson in the television series Empire, and as the host for the reality television series Pimp My Ride. He has also starred in the films Gridiron Gang (2006),  (2008), and Sun Dogs (2017).

West's life took a different direction when his mother, Donda West, died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in November 2007. Months later, West and fiancée Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002. The events profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter. Purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice audio processor Auto-Tune, which would become a central part of his next effort. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals of Jesus Walks and Never Let Me Down. Recorded mostly in Honolulu, Hawaii in three weeks, West announced his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed its lead single, Love Lockdown. Music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune, which typified the pre-release response to the record.

Alain Resnais( 3 June 19221 March 2014) was a French film director and screenwriter whose career extended over more than six decades. After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s, he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog( 1956), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps. Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour( 1959), Last Year at Marienbad( 1961), and Muriel( 1963), all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past. These films were contemporary with, and associated with, the French New Wave( la nouvelle vague), though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement. He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left- wing politics. He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe- Grillet, Jorge Semprún and Jacques Sternberg. In later films, Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms, including theatre, music, and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song. His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness, memory, and the imagination, and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives. Throughout his career, he won many awards from international film festivals and academies.

404,"Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene( died after 1313) was the niece of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, second wife of Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas of Epirus and regent of Epirus upon his death around 1297.

George (Georgios) Palaiologos or Palaeologus  was a Byzantine general, one of the most prominent military commanders and supporters of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118). He was the son of the first known member of the Palaiologos family, the strategos of Mesopotamia Nikephoros Palaiologos. His wife Anna Doukaina was the sister of Irene Doukaina, the wife of Alexios I Komnenos, making him the emperor's brother-in-law. As Alexios Komnenos’ leading general and close friend, he played an important role in his campaigns, especially the Battle of Dyrrhachium against the Normans or the Battle of Levounion against the Pechenegs. He was the chief source used by Anna Komnene in her Alexiad on her father’s battles, and is very favourably portrayed by her in her book as both capable and loyal.

Theodora Palaiologina Synadene  was the daughter of Constantine Palaiologos and Irene Komnene Laskarina Branaina. Through her father, she was a half-niece of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos.

Irene Komnene Laskarina Branaina (died around 1271) was a Byzantine noblewoman and wife of sebastokrator Constantine Palaiologos, half-brother of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. She seems to have followed suit after her husband's retirement to a convent, and taken the monastic name of Maria. She probably died as a nun.

Anna Palaiologina was a Byzantine princess and queen- consort( basilissa) of the Despotate of Epirus. She was a daughter of the Byzantine co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos and his wife Rita of Armenia. Already in 1304, her hand was sought by the Epirote regent, Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, for her son Thomas I Komnenos Doukas; the marriage eventually took place in ca. 1307. When Thomas was murdered by his nephew, Nicholas Orsini, in 1318, the latter took Anna as his wife. She died in 1320.

406,"Miss Seventeen is a reality television show on MTV that aired from October 17, 2005 to December 19, 2005. The show consisted of 17 young women competing for an internship at and a college scholarship. Atoosa Rubenstein was the main judge, she was the youngest editor-in-chief ever to run Seventeen magazine. They picked 17 girls from around the United States who were not only photogenic but also had been at the top of their class, to provide a role model for young women. The girls were flown to New York, where they would take part in a contest similar in format to The Apprentice — they would be given tasks to be done by Atoosa, and in each episode one of the girls would be eliminated from the competition. The winner would get her face on the cover of Seventeen magazine, a college scholarship and would be offered an internship job on the magazine. The criteria for elimination were not only performing poorly — Atoosa was watchful of how the girls talked when no one else was in the room, via cameras set up around the house. In this manner, she could watch the girls with their guards down and see what their real motivations and dreams were. In one elimination, for example, Atoosa sat down with the girl and explained that she didn't feel that the girl was in the contest for the 'right' reasons — video clips were shown to the viewers which showed the girl talking to her other roommates and explaining that she was more interested in the face-time she would get for being part of an MTV show. Where the format differed from other shows was in the first elimination round and in how the contestants found out who was eliminated. In the first episode, all 17 girls sat around the dinner table with Atoosa and had to describe in brief who they were and what they hoped they would get out of the experience. Based on this conversation, Atoosa eliminated 7 of the girls from the contest. The way the girls would generally find out who was eliminated was by sitting around a TV as Atoosa would talk to them, telling them the results of the tasks they were given. The TV screen would then display the names of the girls who would be staying in the house, written in cursive form. The girl whose name didn't appear on 'The List' was eliminated, and met with Atoosa to hear her reasoning for why she was eliminated. In the final episode, Jennifer Steele was declared the winner, with her magazine cover unveiled in Times Square. It was also revealed that Brianne Burrowes, who voluntarily left the show in an early episode of the series, was offered a job by Atoosa and will be working with Jennifer in their respective internships at the magazine.

408,"Meritites I was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 4th dynasty. Her name means Beloved of her Father. Several of her titles are known from a stela found at Giza. She was buried in the middle Queen’s Pyramid in Giza (Pyramid G 1b). Meritites was a daughter of King Sneferu and his consort of unknown name. Meritites married her (half?)brother, King Khufu. With Khufu, she was the mother of the Crown Prince Kawab, and possibly Djedefre. Both Queen Hetepheres II and Pharaoh Khafra have been suggested as children of Meretites I and Khufu as well, and it is possible that Meritites II was a daughter of Meritites I as well. Auguste Mariette recorded a stela at Giza in which Meritites is said to be a favorite of both Sneferu and Khufu: King’s wife, his beloved, devoted to Horus, Mertitytes. King’s wife, his beloved, Mertitytes; beloved of the Favorite of the Two Goddesses; she who says anything whatsoever and it is done for her.

Meritites II( Merytiotes, Meritetes) or Meritites A( beloved of her father) was a 4th dynasty Princess of Ancient Egypt, and probably a daughter of King Khufu. She may have been a daughter of Meritites I based on the fact that this queen is mentioned in mastaba G 7650. She married the Director of the Palace Akhethotep( a non-royal court official) and she had several children with her husband. Meritites and her husband shared a mastaba( G 7650) in Giza.

Meritaten Tasherit, which means Meritaten the Younger was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. The father of this child remains under debate. Many assume it to be none other than Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. The fate of this child is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. Meanwhile, the name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

Ket and Wig appear in the Gesta Danorum as the sons of Frowin, the governor of Schleswig. Wig also appears in the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle as the son of Freawine( Frowin) and father of Gewis, eponymous ancestor of the kingdom of Wessex and their kings, but this is thought to be a late manipulation, inserting these heroes into a pedigree borrowed from a rival royal house, in which the Bernician eponym Bernic was replaced by the Wessex Gewis. Their father Frowin/ Freawine was challenged to combat by the Swedish king Athisl, and killed. King Wermund, who liked their father, subsequently raised Ket and Wig as his own. They later avenged their father, but they fought against Athisl two against one, a national disgrace that was redeemed by their brother- in- law, King Wermund's son Offa, when he killed two Saxons at the same time, in single combat. This event is referred to in Widsith as a duel against Myrgings.

Duchess Marie of Württemberg (Antoinette Friederike Auguste Marie Anna Herzogin von Württemberg; 17 September 1799 – 24 September 1860) was a daughter of Duke Alexander of Württemberg and Antoinette of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.

Duchess Frederica of Württemberg( 27 July 1765 – 24 November 1785) was a daughter of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg and Friederike Dorothea of Brandenburg- Schwedt.

Duchess Anna Dorothea of Saxe-Weimar (12 November 1657 - 24 June 1704) reigned as Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg from 1684 until her death. Born in Weimar, Duchess Anna Dorothea was the daughter of John Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Christine Elisabeth of Holstein-Sonderburg. Her father decided she should pursue an ecclesiastical career when she was still a child. From 1681 until 1684, Anna Dorothea was provost of the Quedlinburg monasteries. Upon the death of Princess-Abbess Anna Sophia II, Anna Dorothea was chosen to succeed her, though not without difficulties that required the intervention of the abbey-principality's guardian and fellow Wettin, John George III, Elector of Saxony. The Elector consented to her election on 4 September 1684 and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I confirmed it on 29 January 1685. In 1698, Frederick Augustus I, who had succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony in 1694 and had been elected King of Poland in 1697, found himself in need of money as the election had cost him a fortune. The King of Poland therefore decided to sell his rights of guardianship of the abbey-principality to Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. The change was not welcomed by the citizens of Quedlinburg nor by the Princess-Abbess, as it led to diminishing of her power and loss of many of the abbey-principality's possessions. The Princess-Abbess protested against the sale and refused to recognise the Elector of Brandenburg as the abbey-principality's new guardian until military occupation the same year forced her to do so. As many of her predecessors, she often came into conflicts with the Council of the City of Quedlinburg and her guardian. Anna Dorothea suffered poor health in 1703 and went to Carlsbad to recover, but without success. She died the next year. She is buried in Weimar.

Duchess Louise Frederica of Württemberg (3 February 1722 – 2 August 1791) was a Duchess consort of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

Sidney Joseph Furie (born February 28, 1933) is a Canadian film director, screenwriter, and producer best known for his extensive work in both British and American cinema between the 1960s and early 1980s. Like his contemporaries Norman Jewison and Ted Kotcheff, he was one of earliest Canadian directors to achieve mainstream critical and financial success outside their native country at a time when its film industry was virtually nonexistent. He won a BAFTA Film Award and was nominated for a Palme d'Or for his work on the acclaimed spy thriller The Ipcress File starring Michael Caine. He is considered by some an auteur director, elevating otherwise unremarkable genre films through strong, creative visuals, and atmospheric direction. His 1981 horror film The Entity was declared by director Martin Scorsese as one of the scariest movies of all time, and his Vietnam War film The Boys in Company C was a major influence on Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.  He is also the co-creator of the Iron Eagle action film franchise, and directed three of its four entries.

423,"Ludlow Massacre is a song by Woody Guthrie about the Ludlow Massacre, a labor conflict in Ludlow, Colorado, in 1914. A related song is the 1913 Massacre. Woody Guthrie wrote:

Massacre Mafia Style( also known as The Executioner or Like Father, Like Son) is a 1974 independent film written, directed, produced by, and starring Italian- American crooner- actor Duke Mitchell. The tagline for the film was You ’re IN, or you ’re IN THE WAY.  Massacre Mafia Style was written, produced, self- financed and directed by Duke Mitchell, and was accumulated from all of his real- life run-ins with similar characters and mob stories. Duke Mitchell was an actor and singer( providing the singing voice of Fred Flintstone in The Flintstones cartoons) and was once part of a comedy duo with partner Sammy Petrillo who together starred in the 1952 cult film Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla with Bela Lugosi of Dracula fame. The pair whose act, Mitchell& Petrillo, was imitative of Martin& Lewis( Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), was sued by Lewis after the Lugosi film was released. Mitchell went on to become a well- known crooner and nightclub act in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and as such, was known as the “ King ” of Palm Springs and ran in some of the same circles as pal Frank Sinatra. His nightclub act revolved around his Sinatra- like crooning and rockabilly Italian- American songs. With such behind- the- scenes access, Mitchell often used several of the nightclubs that he sang in as locations for his films; such places as The Buggy Whip in Los Angeles .<br> Mitchell would use the money he made singing to fund his independent films. Several of Mitchell's projects never saw the light of day, including his next film Gone with the Pope which only existed as a work print when it was found in a garage by Grindhouse Releasing ’s Bob Murawski and Sage Stallone. It was carefully restored and released theatrically in 2011 by Grindhouse Releasing, which has also restored and released Mitchell's Massacre Mafia Style on Blu-ray in 2015. While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic.

My So Called Knife is an album by Lollipop Lust Kill, released in May 2002. The album was recorded in Weed, California with Sylvia Massy- Shivy at the helm. She had previously worked with the metal act Tool. Several titles were proposed for the album, and until very close to its completion, it was to be dubbed Murder at the Late Show, an odious reference to the converted theater in which it was recorded. However, the title was deemed too risque by Artemis records and was subsequently changed to the play on My So Called Life, a show with a sizable cult following. In addition to the tracks present on the album, three other songs; Eyes All LiesDrip, and It's Cold Inside( the latter two being reworked and rerecorded versions of Motel Murder Madness and 2001 demo songs) were recorded. A fourth unreleased track titled Gemini Twin was also recorded, but no one except for the band members has ever heard it. None of the aforementioned tracks were officially released, although the three former songs were widely distributed among' The Lollipop Guild', the band's semi-official and loyal fanbase. Much speculation was also made as to whom the child featured on the album cover was, as the boy's identity was a closely guarded secret. It was eventually revealed that the boy was, in fact, one of the sons of guitarist Pill.

Robert Earl Wise (September 10, 1914 – September 14, 2005) was an American film director, producer, and editor. He won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture for both West Side Story (1961) and The Sound of Music (1965). He was also nominated for Best Film Editing for Citizen Kane (1941) and directed and produced The Sand Pebbles (1966), which was nominated for Best Picture. Among his other films are The Body Snatcher (1945), Born to Kill (1947), The Set-Up (1949), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Destination Gobi (1953), This Could Be The Night (1957), Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), I Want to Live! (1958), The Haunting (1963), The Andromeda Strain (1971), The Hindenburg (1975) and  (1979). Wise was the president of the Directors Guild of America from 1971 to 1975 and the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1984 through 1987. Robert Wise has been viewed as a craftsman, inclined to let the (sometimes studio-assigned) story concept set the style. Later cineastes, such as Martin Scorsese, insist that despite Wise's legendary workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan. Wise achieved critical success as a director in a striking variety of film genres: horror, noir, western, war, science fiction, musical and drama, with many repeat successes within each genre. Wise's meticulous preparation may have been largely motivated by studio budget constraints, but advanced the moviemaking art. Robert Wise received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998.

Charles B. Pierce (June 16, 1938 – March 5, 2010) was an American film director, screenwriter, producer, set decorator, cinematographer and actor, and is considered one of the first modern independent filmmakers. Pierce directed thirteen films over the span of 26 years, but is best known for his cult hits The Legend of Boggy Creek (1973) and The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976). An Arkansas resident most of his life , Pierce made his directorial debut with Boggy Creek, a faux documentary-style film inspired by the legend of the Bigfoot-like Fouke Monster. The low-budget film grossed roughly $25 million, and Pierce followed that success with several inexpensive, regional films set in the southern United States, including The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on the true story of the Phantom Killer murders in Texarkana. Pierce continued directing films into the 1980s, when he wrote the story for the Clint Eastwood film Sudden Impact. For that screenplay, he is said to have written the phrase, Go ahead, make my day, which became one of the most famous movie quotes in history. After years of pressure from producers, Pierce directed a Boggy Creek sequel, , which he considered the worst film of his career; it was later riffed on by the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.

The key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself. There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in Joachimsthal in Czechoslovakia, and in the Belgian Congo. All but Joachimstal were in allied hands.

Florent of Hainaut (also Floris or Florence; Hainaut, also spelled Hainault) (c. 1255 – 23 January 1297) was Prince of Achaea from 1289 to his death, in right of his wife, Isabella of Villehardouin. He was the son of John I of Avesnes and Adelaide of Holland. From his father he received the stadholdership (government) of Zeeland. After he left Zeeland, he took up service with Charles II of Naples, who made him constable of the Kingdom of Naples. After his marriage with Isabella (16 September 1289), he had one daughter: Matilda. She would succeed him and her mother as princess. Florent settled with his wife in Morea. He negotiated the Treaty of Glarentsa with the Byzantine Empire in 1290. The situation for the Franks in Greece was hopeless by this time, however. The fall of the Angevins in Sicily meant that they were preoccupied with recouping territory there and few Western governments would send troops to defend Morea. Florent thus made peace and maintained it until 1293, when the Greeks retook Kalamata. Florent did not despair and did not reopen the war which had been ongoing until his succession: he instead sent an embassy in protest to Andronikos II Palaiologos, and the emperor returned Kalamata. In 1296, the Greeks retook the castle of Saint George in Arcadia. Florent besieged the castle, but died before it could be taken.

Under Influence was the only album of new wave band Zones, released by Arista Records on June 1, 1979. The album contained multi-genred songs, being very far from the early punkier stuff, like in the case of 7 single Stuck with You. Jim Green in Trousser Press distinguished or tried to define it as pop? Hard stuff? Commercial new wave? Reggae-pop?. Although the album has new wave sounds, it was unsuccessful at the time of its release. Shortly afterwards, Zones released a 7 single called Mourning Star, whose eponymous song (a shorter version of the album song) was backed with Under Influence, which did not appear in the album, despite the name being the same. At the end of 1979, and after years of failures, the group split up.

Cobra is a 1986 American action film directed by George P. Cosmatos, and written by Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the title role. The film co-stars Reni Santoni, Brigitte Nielsen and Andrew Robinson. It is the first film where Brian Thompson plays a prominent role. The film was loosely based on the novel Fair Game by Paula Gosling, which was later filmed under that title in 1995. However, Stallone's screenplay was originally conceived from ideas he had during pre-production of Beverly Hills Cop, whose screenplay he heavily revised. He had wanted to make Beverly Hills Cop a less comedic and more action- oriented film, which the studio rejected as being far too expensive. When he left that project, Eddie Murphy was brought in to play the lead role. The film received negative reviews, with much criticism focused on the overuse of genre tropes, yet it debuted at the number one spot on the U.S. box office and became a financial success. It is now considered a cult classic.

Pierce continued directing films into the 1980s, when he wrote the story for the Clint Eastwood film Sudden Impact. For that screenplay, he is said to have written the phrase, Go ahead, make my day, which became one of the most famous movie quotes in history. After years of pressure from producers, Pierce directed a Boggy Creek sequel, , which he considered the worst film of his career; it was later riffed on by the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Chrétien du Bois( 1597- 1655) was a French official in the Comté( Count) of Coupigny. ( variant names Corstiaen( Christaesne, Christophe. Noel, Noue, Cristoff, Crijin, Cretien, Gristyn, Guislain) Many languages were spoken in the region, Old French( Flemish- French), Dutch, German, and Corsican since Flanders area was part of the Spanish Netherlands. He was the father of three Protestant French- speaking immigrants to colonial New York. One of these, Louis Dubois, was among the founders of New Paltz, New York, in the late 1600s. Chretien du Bois was the son of Antoine du Bois and Anne Cousin, and was married to Françoise le Poivre. Chretien du Bois lived in the village of Wicres, outside of Lille. Documents from the Archives Départementales de Lille indicate he was bailli, lieutenant, greffier& receveur of the Comté of Coupigny. He died sometime after 1641. Further information of the area and genealogy can be obtained from the town website https://www.annequin.fr/histoire.htm which states( Modern French) Between 1425 and 1550, we have little information about Annequin and his lords. We can just quote them. The son of Philip, John II of the Bos lived 71 years( 1425- 1496). Then Jean III du Bos succeeded him until 1501. Anne du Bos then benefited from the lordship until his death in 1516. It is then his son Antoine du Bos( said Antoine de Fiennes) who is the owner until 1537. Finally, Charles du Bois became the lord until 1550, and Eustache de Fiennes succeeded him. If the sources remain meager, they allow however to know a little more about Eustache de Fiennes. This lord of Annequin is also Count of Chaumont, Viscount of Fruges, Baron of Elnes, and Lord of Esquerdes. Converted to Calvinism, he takes part in the troubles that shake the Artois remained Catholic in the last third of the sixteenth century. He is one of the Protestant leaders who support the Prince of Orange against Spain( Catholic) who administers our region by inheritance from Charles V. In 1577, Eustache de Fiennes was even the leader of the Orange party in Saint- Omer, and in 1578 he participated in the Calvinist attempts to seize power in Arras. Unfortunately for him, this project is a failure and leads him, in 1585, before the Council of Disturbances, which condemned him to banishment and confiscation of his property, including the lordship of Annequin. He died in 1596, and his son Guislain sold the lordship ten years later, to Maximilien du Chastel. in French https://www.annequin.fr/histoire.htm Entre 1425 et 1550, nous ne disposons que de peu d’information sur Annequin et ses seigneurs. Nous pouvons simplement les citer. Le fils de Philippe, Jean II du Bos vécut 71 ans( 1425- 1496). Puis Jean III du Bos lui a succédé jusqu'en 1501. Anne du Bos a ensuite bénéficié de la seigneurie jusqu'à sa mort en 1516. C’est alors son fils Antoine du Bos( dit Antoine de Fiennes) qui en est le propriétaire jusqu'en 1537. Enfin, Charles du Bois en devient le seigneur jusqu'en 1550, et Eustache de Fiennes lui succède. Si les sources restent maigres, elles permettent toutefois d ’en savoir un peu plus sur Eustache de Fiennes. Ce seigneur d’ Annequin est également comte de Chaumont, vicomte de Fruges, baron d' Elnes, et seigneur d'Esquerdes. Converti au calvinisme, il prend part aux troubles qui secouent l'Artois demeurée catholique dans le dernier tiers du XVI ° siècle. Il est l’un des chefs protestants qui soutiennent le prince d' Orange contre l'Espagne( catholique) qui administre notre région par héritage de Charles- Quint. En 1577, Eustache de Fiennes est même le meneur du parti orangiste à Saint- Omer, et en 1578, il participe aux tentatives calvinistes de prise de pouvoir à Arras. Malheureusement pour lui, ce projet est un échec et le conduit, en 1585, devant le Conseil des troubles qui le condamne au bannissement et à la confiscation de ses biens, do nt la seigneurie d'Annequin. Il meurt en 1596, et son fils Guislain vend la seigneurie une dizaine d'année plus tard, à Maximilien du Chastel. Some internet pages claim that Chretien du Bois' wife was named Cornelia. This claim was first made by researcher Matthew Hilt Murphy in a 1980 presentation later re-printed in William Heidgerd, The American Descendants of Chretien Dubois of Wicres, France. Murphy referenced a 1646 item in the church records of Middlebourg, Zeeland referring to Bois/ Cornelia du/ vefve de Jen de Chrestien, native de Tournay. Murphy has been identified as one who apparently was not familiar with French naming patterns, and his work denounced. However, although the French custom of referring to women in documents by their maiden names is correct, naming patterns in the 15th and 16th century traditionally identify a location as the last name, following through with any identifying titles. We can see this naming pattern change in the late 17th century, with immigration patterns as the VOC expanded their trade routes. Murphy identified to a woman who had married( 1) Jean du Bois and( 2) Chretien DuBois. In fact, the record refers to a woman whose maiden name was Cornelia du Bois, who was the widow of Jean de Chrestien. This does not identify Cretien du Bois, as there are many with variants of the last name Chrestien in the Nord archives, and many variations of Cornelia, which is a Dutch variant of Helene or the English variant of Elenore. There is also transcription variations from older records on the name Cretien, with some identifying it as being misinterpreted from Sacré- tien. Chretien du Bois is of particular interest to American genealogists, both because of the notability of his descendants and because several different versions of noble ancestry have been claimed for him. Further DNA testing of several descendants including Sarah Du Bois Van Meter have tested positive in the nobility lineage. Several prominent Americans figure among Chretien du Bois' descendants, including former governor of Massachusetts William Floyd Weld, actor Marlon Brando, Jr., painter Mary Cassatt, journalist Maria Shriver( wife of California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger), Samuel Walton, General George Smith Patton III and film director George Lucas. W. E. B. Du Bois is also said to be a descendant.

Murder Ahoy! is the last of four Miss Marple films made by Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer that starred Margaret Rutherford. As in the previous three, the actress plays Agatha Christie's amateur sleuth Miss Jane Marple, with Charles' Bud' Tingwell as( Chief) Inspector Craddock and Stringer Davis( Rutherford's real- life husband) playing Mr Stringer. The film was made in 1964 and directed by George Pollock, with David Pursall and Jack Seddon credited with the script. The music was by Ron Goodwin. Location shots included Denham Village and St Mawes, Cornwall. Unlike the previous three films that were adapted from Christie novels – The 4.50 from PaddingtonMurder, She Said – the only Miss Marple novel used), After the Funeral( a Poirot mystery, adapted for Miss Marple with the title Murder at the Gallop) and Mrs. McGinty's Dead( another Poirot novel, adapted as Murder Most Foul) – this film used an original screenplay that was not based on any of Christie's stories. It does, however, employ elements of the Miss Marple story They Do It With Mirrors. Specifically, the Battledore is a training ship for teenage boys with criminal tendencies, who are supposedly being set on the straight and narrow path – when, in fact, one of the members of the crew is training them for careers in housebreaking. Likewise, in They Do It With Mirrors, Lewis Serrocold is running his wife's mansion, Stonygates, as a boarding school for delinquent youths, to straighten out their lives – but, in fact, he is training selected students to hone their criminal skills, not to give them up. That is the only element borrowed into the film from a Christie story. There is also an entirely tongue- in- cheek reference to The Mousetrap, the Christie play that has been running continuously on the West End since 1952. Audiences who see The Mousetrap are asked to keep the ending a secret, so it is amusing when Rutherford's Miss Marple says that she's reading a rattling- good detective yarn and I hope I wo n't be giving too much away if I say the answer is a mousetrap! She then notes that she'll say no more – otherwise, I'll spoil it for you!

On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever) is a song written by Burton Lane (music) and Alan Jay Lerner (lyrics) for the 1965 musical  On a Clear Day You Can See Forever. It was subsequently performed by American actress and vocalist Barbra Streisand in the 1970 film adaptation of the musical. Three variations of the song appear in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack album produced by Wally Gold: the initial version sung by co-star Yves Montand, a reprise version sung by Streisand, and an orchestral version performed alongside a live chorus. The Streisand rendition was released by Columbia Records as a promotional single on 7 vinyl (with a stereo mix on one side and mono on the other) in July 1970. The track received positive reviews from music critics, with many of them listing it as a highlight of the soundtrack.

Thunderbird 6 is a 1968 British science- fiction puppet film based on Thunderbirds, a Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and produced by their company AP Films( APF; renamed Century 21 in 1966). Written by the Andersons and directed by David Lane, it is a sequel to Thunderbirds Are Go( 1966). The film is largely set on Skyship One – a futuristic airship designed by Brains, the inventor of International Rescue's Thunderbird machines. The plot sees Alan Tracy, Tin -Tin Kyrano, Lady Penelope and Parker representing International Rescue as guests of honour on Skyship One s round- the- world maiden flight, unaware that master criminal The Hood is once again plotting to acquire the organisation's technological secrets. The Hood's agents murder the airship's crew and assume their identities to lure International Rescue into a trap. Meanwhile, Brains' efforts to design a proposed sixth Thunderbird collide with fate when Skyship One is damaged and its occupants' only salvation seems to be Alan's old Tiger Moth biplane. Actors John Carson and Geoffrey Keen provided guest voices, with additions to the regular voice cast in the form of Keith Alexander and Gary Files. The puppet design compromised between the caricatures that APF had used up until Thunderbirds Are Go and the realistically- proportioned marionettes that were introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. The film was shot between May and December 1967. Some of the sequences showing the Tiger Moth in flight were shot on location using a full- sized plane, but a legal dispute with the Ministry of Transport over alleged dangerous flying forced the crew to film the remaining shots in- studio with scale models.  Thunderbird 6 was released in July 1968 to a mediocre box office response that ruled out the production of further sequels. Critical response has remained mixed: while the special effects have been praised, the story polarised commentators.

Marguerite Lundgren was born to a Swedish father and English mother and during her childhood lived both in Sweden and England, being fluent in both languages. Through an aunt, who was one of the founders of the Wynstones School in Gloucestershire, she was able to attend the Michael Hall school, then in South London. This stimulated her interest in eurythmy, which she went on to study with Lieselotte Mann in England. In 1946, after completing her training, she joined the stage group at the. Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, where her originality and talent were quickly spotted by the troupe leader, Marie Savitch. This led to a lifelong bond and common research between the two women.

Boogeyman 2 is a 2007 American supernatural horror film edited and directed by Jeff Betancourt and the sequel to the 2005 film Boogeyman. The film was written by Brian Sieve and stars Danielle Savre, Matt Cohen, Tobin Bell and Renee O'Connor. Savre portrays Laura Porter, a woman who witnessed her parents' murder alongside her brother as a child. She believes the killer to be the Boogeyman, and now as an adult seeks group therapy to overcome her phobia of the creature. However, her fears become reality as her fellow patients are murdered one by one. Due to the previous film's financial success, Boogeyman 2 was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December of the same year with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the former hospital, Linda Vista Community Hospital, over a four- month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural being, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature.

After screening at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 20, 2007, Boogeyman 2 was released direct- to- video in the United States on January 8, 2008; it was later released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered it to be a general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human- like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary creature features, including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, Boogeyman 3, the following year.

Clouzot also directed documentary films, including The Mystery of Picasso, which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.

His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947. After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres.

Massacre Mafia Style( also known as The Executioner or Like Father, Like Son) is a 1974 independent film written, directed, produced by, and starring Italian- American crooner- actor Duke Mitchell. The tagline for the film was You ’re IN, or you ’re IN THE WAY.  Massacre Mafia Style was written, produced, self- financed and directed by Duke Mitchell, and was accumulated from all of his real- life run-ins with similar characters and mob stories. Duke Mitchell was an actor and singer( providing the singing voice of Fred Flintstone in The Flintstones cartoons) and was once part of a comedy duo with partner Sammy Petrillo who together starred in the 1952 cult film Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla with Bela Lugosi of Dracula fame. The pair whose act, Mitchell& Petrillo, was imitative of Martin& Lewis( Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), was sued by Lewis after the Lugosi film was released. Mitchell went on to become a well- known crooner and nightclub act in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and as such, was known as the “ King ” of Palm Springs and ran in some of the same circles as pal Frank Sinatra. His nightclub act revolved around his Sinatra- like crooning and rockabilly Italian- American songs. With such behind- the- scenes access, Mitchell often used several of the nightclubs that he sang in as locations for his films; such places as The Buggy Whip in Los Angeles .<br> Mitchell would use the money he made singing to fund his independent films. Several of Mitchell's projects never saw the light of day, including his next film Gone with the Pope which only existed as a work print when it was found in a garage by Grindhouse Releasing ’s Bob Murawski and Sage Stallone. It was carefully restored and released theatrically in 2011 by Grindhouse Releasing, which has also restored and released Mitchell's Massacre Mafia Style on Blu-ray in 2015. While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic.

Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis is a documentary film that premiered in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival. It is a collection of interviews and clips by and about the revolutionary artist Jack Smith. It was directed by Mary Jordan and produced by Tongue Press Productions. The film was given a limited release in New York movie theaters beginning on April 11, 2007. Jordan is a Canadian- born filmmaker known for her documentary shorts resulting from extended visits to Africa and Southeast Asia. David Ebony, whose review of the film appeared in Art in America, had met Smith in the late 70s soon after moving to New York and at that time attempted to assist him with a number of' slide- show performances.' Ebony's review, following the documentary, covers some of the difficult exhibition history of Flaming Creatures( 1963), Smith's best known film, and difficult collaborations with Jonas Mekas and Andy Warhol and others. Voiceovers from Smith, culled from some 14 hours of interviews with various critics and friends, supplemented the archival visual materials, footage and extensive interviews with filmmaker John Waters, Smith's sister Mary Sue Slater, playwright Richard Foreman, Smith and Warhol star Mario Montez, writer Gary Indiana, and musician John Zorn, among others. Ebony concludes that the film manages to evoke the quirky and often cantankerous personality of its subject without ever making him seem merely a disgruntled artist and social misfit, as some may think him. ... I feel that Jordan's multifaceted and impassioned portrait rings true. Smith, in fact, comes off in the film as an ingenious art- world Cassandra, more relevant today than ever. Wesley Morris, whose review appeared in the Boston Globe, was impressed that Jordan manages to conjure Smith's story while also telling a story about art in America, concluding that Smith was a pioneer of the sort of event that just does n't seem possible in an age when counterculture feels like mass culture and very little art is shocking.

Starting in 1955 he began producing movies, first with his company Urania: The films The Man in the Black Derby and The Model Husband starring Swiss comedian Walter Roderer turned into big successes. At around the time where the Edgar Wallace thrillers became popular in Germany, Erwin brought Nylon Noose and The Strangler of the Tower starring German movie stars, such as Dietmar Schönherr, to the cinemas.

Where was the place of burial of Neith (Wife Of Pepi Ii)'s husband?",pepi ii was buried in saqqara egypt,saqqara,0.4789804220199585,0.2789425453258252,False
529,"Ankhesenpepi II or Ankhesenmeryre II was a queen consort during the sixth dynasty of Egypt. She was the wife of Kings Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, and the mother of Pepi II. She was buried in a pyramid in Saqqara.

Pepi II (also Pepy II; 2284 BC – after 2247 BC, probably either 2216 or 2184 BC) was a pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt's Old Kingdom who reigned from 2278 BC. His throne name, Neferkare (Nefer-ka-Re), means Beautiful is the Ka of Re. He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks—the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II—were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II. Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.

Neith was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, one of the principal queens of the Old Kingdom pharaoh Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled (c. 2278 BC – c. 2184 BC). Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.

Ankhesenpepi IV was an ancient Egyptian queen, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi II of the Sixth dynasty. She was the mother of King Neferkare II. Pepi II also had several other wives.

Walker was born into a prominent Boston family, the son of the economist and politician Amasa Walker, and he graduated from Amherst College at the age of 20. He received a commission to join the 15th Massachusetts Infantry and quickly rose through the ranks as an assistant adjutant general. Walker fought in the Peninsula Campaign and was wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville but subsequently participated in the Bristoe, Overland, and Richmond- Petersburg Campaigns before being captured by Confederate forces and held at the infamous Libby Prison. In July 1866, he was nominated by President Andrew Johnson and confirmed by the United States Senate for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general United States Volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, when he was age 24. Following the war, Walker served on the editorial staff of the Springfield Republican before using his family and military connections to gain appointment as the Chief of the Bureau of Statistics from 1869 to 1870 and Superintendent of the 1870 census where he published an award- winning Statistical Atlas visualizing the data for the first time. He joined Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School as a professor of political economy in 1872 and rose to international prominence serving as a chief member of the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, American representative to the 1878 International Monetary Conference, President of the American Statistical Association in 1882, and inaugural President of the American Economic Association in 1886, and vice president of the National Academy of Sciences in 1890. Walker also led the 1880 census which resulted in a twenty- two volume census, cementing Walker's reputation as the nation's preeminent statistician. As an economist, Walker debunked the wage- fund doctrine and engaged in a prominent scholarly debate with Henry George on land, rent, and taxes. Walker argued in support of bimetallism and although he was an opponent of the nascent socialist movement, he argued that obligations existed between the employer and the employed. He published his International Bimetallism at the height of the 1896 presidential election campaign in which economic issues were prominent. Walker was a prolific writer, authoring ten books on political economy and military history. In recognition of his contributions to economic theory, beginning in 1947, the American Economic Association recognized the lifetime achievement of an individual economist with a Francis A. Walker Medal. Walker accepted the presidency of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1881, a position he held for fifteen years until his death. During his tenure, he placed the institution on more stable financial footing by aggressively fund- raising and securing grants from the Massachusetts government, implemented many curricular reforms, oversaw the launch of new academic programs, and expanded the size of the Boston campus, faculty, and student enrollments. MIT's Walker Memorial Hall, a former students' clubhouse and one of the original buildings on the Charles River campus, was dedicated to him in 1916.

Pablo, a successful gay film director, disappointed in his relationship with his young lover, Juan, concentrates in a new project, a monologue starring his transsexual sister, Tina. Antonio, an uptight young man, falls possessively in love with the director and in his passion would stop at nothing to obtain the object of his desire. The relationship between Pablo and Antonio is at the core of the film, however, the story and own drama of Pablo's sister, Tina, plays a strong role in the plot.

550,"Isabella of England (16 June 1332 –) was the eldest daughter of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault, and the wife of Enguerrand de Coucy, Earl of Bedford, by whom she had two daughters. She was made a Lady of the Garter in 1376.

Isabella of France (1295 – 22 August 1358), sometimes described as the She-Wolf of France , was Queen of England as the wife of Edward II, and regent of England from 1327 until 1330. She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She became a femme fatale figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure. Isabella arrived in England at the age of 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward later turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser and by 1325 her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point. Travelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the wars with Scotland. In 1330, Isabella's son Edward III deposed Mortimer in turn, taking back his authority and executing Mortimer. The Queen was not punished, however, and lived for many years in considerable style—although not at Edward III's court, though she often visited to dote on her grandchildren and was marginally involved in peace talks—until her death in 1358.

Nesta Helen Webster( 24 August 1876 – 16 May 1960) was an English conspiracy theorist, who revived theories about the Illuminati. She claimed that the secret society's members were occultists, plotting communist world domination, through a Jewish cabal, the Masons and Jesuits. She blamed the group for events including the French Revolution, 1848 Revolution, the First World War, and the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1920, Webster was one of the contributing authors who wrote The Jewish Peril, a series of articles in the London Morning Post centred on the antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. These articles were compiled and published in the same year in book form under the title of The Cause of World Unrest. Webster claimed that the authenticity of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was an open question.

Thomas Bertram Lonsdale Webster( 3 July 1905 – 31 May 1974) was an English archaeologist and Classicist, known for his studies of Greek comedy. During World War I he attended Charterhouse. As a student at Oxford University, he first studied Greek vases that John Beazley had brought in, but soon switched to Menander and developed a lifelong interest in Greek comedy that resulted in reconstructions of the plots of lost plays and ... collections of evidence from widely disparate sources bearing on the history of the Greek theater. He followed William Moir Calder( 1880 – 1960) as Hulme Professor of Greek at Manchester University, a position he held 1931 – 48, when he was followed by H. D.( Henry) Westlake( 1906 – 92).

During World War II he served as an officer in the military intelligence. After his wife, the Classicist A. M.

Daniel Webster (January 18, 1782 – October 24, 1852) was an American statesman who represented New Hampshire and Massachusetts in the United States Congress and served as the United States Secretary of State under Presidents William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, and Millard Fillmore. He was also a prominent attorney, especially during the period of the Marshall Court. Throughout his career, he was a member of the Federalist Party, the National Republican Party, and the Whig Party. Born in New Hampshire in 1782, Webster established a successful legal practice in Portsmouth, New Hampshire after undergoing a legal apprenticeship. He emerged as a prominent opponent of the War of 1812 and won election to the United States House of Representatives, where he served as a leader of the Federalist Party. Webster left office after two terms and relocated to Boston, Massachusetts. He became a leading attorney before the Supreme Court of the United States, winning cases such as Dartmouth College v. WoodwardMcCulloch v. Maryland, and Gibbons v. Ogden. Webster returned to the House in 1823 and became a key supporter of President John Quincy Adams. He won election to the United States Senate in 1827 and worked with Henry Clay to build the National Republican Party in support of Adams. After Andrew Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, Webster became a leading opponent of Jackson's domestic policies. He strongly objected to the theory of nullification espoused by John C. Calhoun, and his Second Reply to Hayne speech is widely regarded as one of the greatest speeches ever delivered in Congress. Webster supported Jackson's defiant response to the Nullification Crisis, but broke with the president due to disagreements over the Second Bank of the United States. Webster joined with other Jackson opponents in forming the Whig Party, and unsuccessfully ran in the 1836 presidential election. He supported Harrison in the 1840 presidential election and was appointed secretary of state after Harrison took office. Unlike the other members of Harrison's Cabinet, he continued to serve under President Tyler after Tyler broke with congressional Whigs. As secretary of state, Webster negotiated the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which settled border disputes with Britain. Webster returned to the Senate in 1845 and resumed his status as a leading congressional Whig. During the Mexican–American War, he emerged as a leader of the Cotton Whigs, a faction of Northern Whigs that emphasized good relations with the South over anti-slavery policies. In 1850, President Fillmore appointed Webster as secretary of state, and Webster contributed to the passage of the Compromise of 1850, which settled several territorial issues and enacted a new fugitive slave law. The Compromise proved unpopular in much of the North and undermined Webster's standing in his home state. Webster sought the Whig nomination in the 1852 presidential election, but a split between supporters of Fillmore and Webster led to the nomination of General Winfield Scott. Webster is widely regarded as an important and talented attorney, orator, and politician, but historians and observers have offered mixed opinions on his moral qualities and ability as a national leader.

Daniel Fletcher Webster, commonly known as Fletcher Webster (July 25, 1813 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire – August 30, 1862) was the son of renowned politician Daniel Webster and Grace Fletcher Webster.

The Last Mitterrand( French title: Le Promeneur du Champ de Mars) is a 2005 film directed by Robert Guédiguian depicting the final period in the life of an unnamed French President( but the English title suggests the president is François Mitterrand). The film is based on the book Le Dernier Mitterrand by Georges- Marc Benamou. Benamou had talked with and accompanied Mitterrand for the last 1,000 days of his presidency. Benamou worked for a small circulation magazine called Globe- a magazine for champagne socialistsla gauche caviar in the French idiom. It is not clear why Mitterrand chose Benamou but the journalist has said they got on well and discussed life, women and literature. When the resulting book appeared in 1997 however, Benamou was turned upon by many of Mitterrand's family and associates- even Pierre Bergé, who financed the Globe magazine called it a work of absolute treachery- and they would not help with the film. It seems they were particularly outraged not by revelations about Mitterrand's private life,- Mitterrand had a secret second family including the daughter he kept hidden from the public- or anything to do with Vichy, but with a description of Mitterrand devouring a plateful of ortolans. The bird is a protected species and eating them forbidden under EU law. Certain other people at the dinner called Benamou a liar saying this incident never happened. Benamou denied this. In 2004 one of Mitterrand's closest associates, who had also been at the meal said Benamou was right but no ortolans appear in the film and Mitterrand eats a plate of oysters. Benamou, an Algerian born Sephardic Jew, asserted that he had not found Mitterrand anti-semitic either in his time in Vichy or afterwards,- something that Mitterrand, who sometimes spoke of' le lobby juif', his term for some French Jews' and their focus on his wartime record- had been accused of. Benamou defended Mitterrand in spite of his protection of collaborators like René Bousquet and Maurice Papon- Papon became a minister under Giscard d'Estaing; he was chief of police under de Gaulle. This is not a secret of Mitterrand[ but of] the French bourgeoisie and Mitterrand was an emblem of that. The film won a César award for Michel Bouquet in his role as Mitterrand.

Flora Lake is a remote lake located in the northern environs of Yosemite National Park, California, United States. The lake is located in a rugged environment that is only accessible to intrepid hikers. The lake was once proposed as a cavalry outpost for the U.S. Army as it provided easy access to the northern border of Yosemite. During the early 20th century the U.S. military was burdened with protecting the newly formed National Park System. Shortly after the park's creation, many wilderness outposts were created in order to curb the illegal intrusion of goat herds which shepherds would lead into the park. This activity routinely devastated otherwise pristine valleys. Today the lake offers solitude and beauty that characterize those portions of northern Yosemite National Park and the adjacent Emigrant Wilderness.

As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical characteristics, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it; these duplicates, however, are devoid of all human emotion. Little by little, a local doctor uncovers this quiet invasion and attempts to stop it. The slang expression pod people that arose in late 20th century American culture references the emotionless duplicates seen in the film.  Invasion of the Body Snatchers was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.

571,"Ravikant Nagaich( 5 July 1931 – 6 January 1991, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu) was an Indian film personality born at Atrauli, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India in a Brahmin family. He started his filming career as a cinematographer in Telugu films, N.T. Rama Rao's Sri Seetha Rama Kalyanam in 1961 being his first film. With Farz, he turned to Hindi movies and direction. This low- budget thriller inspired by James Bond was a surprise hit and helped Ravikant and the film's lead pair's( Jeetendra and Babita) career. Dharmendra acted as Agent 116 Gopal in Keemat( 1973). Jeetendra reprised his role as Agent 116, Gopalkishan Pandey in Raksha( 1982) and again in The Gold Medal( 1984). He went on to direct 24 more films Duty being his last. Though he had some big budget hits like Mere Jeevan Saathi and The Train( 1970 film), his low budget fare such as Surakshaa and Wardaat- again in the secret agent mode like Farz, Keemat and Raksha- are his remembered hits due to the tacky stunts and special effects and the fact that despite these drawbacks the films did well. Mithun Chakravorty too benefitted from Surakshaa to move to commercial films as Jeetendra had earlier with Farz. He also produced two films in the 1980s: Wardaat and Shapath.

The cinematographer was Tirru and editing was done by T. S. Suresh. Geethaanjali was released worldwide on 14 November 2013. The film being an official remake of Alone was undisclosed before release, as a result, it was criticised as an imitation of Alone and its source material, the novel Elephants Can Remember, and other Indian films adapted from the film or novel. Mohanlal's performance, the cinematography and the graphics received praise.

Who is Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (Executed 39)'s father-in-law?",julius caesar,germanicus,0.3744783401489258,0.0,False
572,"Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger or Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor (died 30 BC), was the only child of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and his wife Junia Secunda, a half-sister to Brutus the Younger, one of Julius Caesar's assassins.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 30 BC – 33 AD) was a Roman senator, politician and general, praised by the historian Tacitus.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 230 – 152 BC) was a twice Roman consul, Pontifex Maximus, Censor and Princeps Senatus. A scion of the ancient Patrician gens Aemilia, he was most likely the son of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, with his brothers being Lucius and Quintus. According to Polybius, Lepidus was the handsomest man of his time, as well as, in the words of Diodorus, being gifted with superior intelligence. Combining these qualities with an impeccable aristocratic birth, political skill and a reputation for bravery, Lepidus soon rose to become one of the leading Romans of his generation. Lepidus was the great- grandfather of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Triumvir.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( died 216 BC) was the Roman consul for 232 BC, and according to Livy served again as suffect consul, possibly in 221. He also served at one time as augur. He died in 216. It was in Lepidus' honor that the first gladiatorial games( munera) were held, on the occasion of his death. He was survived by his three sons; Lucius, Quintus, and Marcus. The latter was most likely the Marcus Aemilius Lepidus who was a Roman consul and Pontifex Maximus in the early 2nd century BC.

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( 120 BC – 77 BC) was a Roman statesman and general. After the death of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, he attempted to undermine the Sullan constitution and revive the populares faction. This brought him into conflict with the optimates whom Sulla had put back in power. In 77 BC, when he was recalled from his proconsulship of Gaul, he returned to Rome at the head of an army and an armed conflict erupted. Lepidus' forces were defeated in a battle near the Milvian Bridge and as a result his rebellion failed. He was the father of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and of one of the consuls for 50 BC Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus.

575,"Charles XI, also Carl  (24 November 1655 – 5 April 1697 OS) was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611–1718). He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.

Charles XIII, or Carl XIII, (7 October 1748 – 5 February 1818), was King of Sweden (as Charles XIII) from 1809 and King of Norway (proclaimed as Charles XIII but in recent times accurately referred to as Charles II) from 1814 to his death. He was the second son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, sister of Frederick the Great. Though known as King Charles XIII in Sweden, he was actually the seventh Swedish king by that name, as Charles IX (reigned 1604–1611) had adopted his numeral after studying a fictitious history of Sweden.

Maximilian Emanuel of Württemberg-Winnental (Stuttgart, February 27, 1689 – Dubno, September 25, 1709), son of Frederick Charles of Württemberg-Winnental and Margravine Eleonore Juliane of Brandenburg-Ansbach, was a volunteer in the army of Charles XII of Sweden and a devoted friend to the king.

Charles IX, also Carl (4 October 1550 – 30 October 1611), was King of Sweden from 1604 until his death. He was the youngest son of King Gustav I and his second wife, Margaret Leijonhufvud, brother of Eric XIV and John III, and uncle of Sigismund who was king of both Sweden and Poland. By his father's will he got, by way of appanage, the Duchy of Södermanland, which included the provinces of Närke and Värmland; but he did not come into actual possession of them till after the fall of Eric and the succession to the throne of John in 1568. Both Charles and one of his predecessors, Eric XIV (1560–68), took their regnal numbers according to a fictitious history of Sweden. He was actually the third Swedish king called Charles. He came into the throne by championing the Protestant cause during the increasingly tense times of religious strife between competing sects of Christianity. In just over a decade, these would break out as the Thirty Years' War. These conflicts had already caused the dynastic squabble rooted in religious freedom that deposed his nephew and brought him to rule as king of Sweden. His reign marked the start of the final chapter (dated 1648 by some) of both the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. With his brother's death in November 1592, the throne of Sweden went to his nephew and Habsburg ally, Sigismund of Poland and Sweden. During these tense political times, Charles viewed the inheritance of the throne of Protestant Sweden by his devout Roman Catholic nephew with alarm. Thus, several years of religious controversy and discord followed. During the period, Charles and the Swedish privy council ruled in Sigismund's name while he stayed in Poland. After various preliminaries, the Riksdag of the Estates forced Sigismund to abdicate the throne to Charles IX in 1595. This eventually kicked off nearly seven decades of sporadic warfare as the two lines of the divided House of Vasa both continued to attempt to remake the union between the Polish and Swedish thrones with opposing counter-claims and dynastic wars. Quite likely, the dynastic outcome between Sweden and Poland's House of Vasa exacerbated and radicalized the later actions of Europe's Catholic princes in the German states such as the Edict of Restitution. In fact, it worsened European politics to the abandonment or prevention of settling events by diplomacy and compromise during the vast bloodletting that was the Thirty Years' war.

Maximilian Emanuel of Württemberg-Winnental (Stuttgart, February 27, 1689 – Dubno, September 25, 1709), son of Frederick Charles of Württemberg-Winnental and Margravine Eleonore Juliane of Brandenburg-Ansbach, was a volunteer in the army of Charles XII of Sweden and a devoted friend to the king. In 1703, at age 14 he joined Charles XII's Polish campaign before the Battle of Putusk, and was since known throughout the army as the Little Prince. On June 18, 1708 he was wounded by the River Berezina while attempting to shield the king from bullets, but recovered in time to fight in the Battle of Holowczyn. He was later made colonel of the Buchwald's Dragoons. In the Battle of Poltava he was captured by the Russians. Released shortly after, he died on the way home at Dubno in Volhynia. King Charles long mourned the loss of his best and truest friend. His heart was buried at St. Gumbertus Church in Ansbach.

576,"I Might Have Been Queen is a song written for Tina Turner as the first track on her highly successful Private Dancer album, and later included as a re-mixed version, with an additional lyric added to the bridge, on her What's Love Got to Do With It soundtrack album. The song was written by Jeanette Obstoj, Rupert Hine, and Jamie West-Oram for the Private Dancer album. The lyrics are meant to be autobiographical, telling Turner's story. Following a discussion with Rupert Hine, co-writer Jeannette Obstoj spoke with Turner about her life, starting with the cotton fields in Nutbush, Tennessee. They also discussed Turner's interest in Egypt and her belief in previous lives, including her apparent belief that in a prior life she was Hatshepsut, a Pharaoh who took the throne from her brother.

A veteran of the Soviet – Afghan War, he ran a religious school called the Institute of Islamic Studies in Kandahar, Afghanistan, from the late 1990s until the American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.

He was the son of the fourteenth Sultan, Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah and the legitimate heir to the throne of Terengganu. Sultan Sulaiman died on 25 September 1942 of blood poisoning.

When the British returned after the end of World War II, they declined to recognise Sultan Ali. Allegedly, Sultan Ali was too much in debt and had been too close to the Japanese during their occupation. According to Sultan Ali, the British Military Administration wanted him removed for his refusal to sign the Malayan Union treaty. The British Military Administration also disapproved of Sultan Ali's character, where he was said to have repudiated his official consort Tengku Putri Hajjah ‘ Ain ul- Jamal, Tengku Sri Nila Utama of Pahang( the daughter of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang) and had contracted an unsuitable second marriage to a former prostitute.

The Janissaries eventually deposed and imprisoned him, and placed his cousin Mustafa on the throne as Mustafa IV. Selim was subsequently killed by a group of assassins.

He was the son of Iyasu I and Empress Malakotawit. He is often referred to as Irgum Tekle Haymanot or Tekle Haymanot the Cursed Tekle Haymanot became Emperor following Iyasus' retirement to an island in Lake Tana. With the support of his mother Empress Malakotawit, some of the officials argued, after the precedent of king Kaleb, that Iyasu had abdicated, and crowned Tekle Haymanot ngusä nägäst in Gondar. This act was not embraced by the entire state, and the resulting civil strife led to Iyasu's murder at the order of his son Tekle Haymanot. In September, 1707, a rebel in Gojjam declared himself ngusä nägäst under the name Amda Seyon, and made his way to the capital city, where he had himself crowned. Tekle Haymanot quickly returned to Gondar, despite the difficulty of travel during the rainy season, forced the usurper to flee, and celebrated his triumph. Amda Seyon was later killed in battle in Maitsa. However his unpopularity for having ordered the murder of his widely revered father was profound and he never overcame it. The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or Era of the Princes( a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.

His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express (1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

In Irish traditional history Eógan( or Eoghan Mór—a name also used by his grandfather, Mug Nuadat), eldest son of Ailill Ollamh, was a 2nd or 3rd century AD king of Munster. He is credited with founding or at least giving his name to the Eóganachta, a dynasty which ruled as kings of Munster and later princes of Desmond until the late 16th century. The son of Éogan Mór was Fiachu Muillethan. His mother was Sadb ingen Chuinn, daughter of Conn of the Hundred Battles.

Eochaid (or Eochu) Ailtlethan (broad blade), son of Ailill Caisfiaclach, was, according to medieval Irish legends and historical traditions, a High King of Ireland. According to the Lebor Gabála Érenn, he took the throne after overthrowing and killing the previous incumbent, Adamair, and ruled for eleven years, until he was killed in battle by Fergus Fortamail. The Lebor Gabála Érenn synchronises his reign with that of Ptolemy V Epiphanes in Egypt (204–181 BC). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar Éirinn dates his reign to 285–274 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters (which gives him a reign of seventeen years) to 414–396 BC.

What is the date of birth of Francis Otto, Duke Of Brunswick-Lüneburg's father?",april 9 1723,27 june 1497,0.6218793392181396,0.0,False
598,"Francis Otto, Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg( 1530 – 1559) was the Prince of Lüneburg from 1555 to 1559. He was the son of Ernest I, Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg.

Otto III, Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg( 1296 – 19 August 1352) was Prince of Lüneburg from 1330 to 1352.

Otto, Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg( 24 August 1495 – 11 August 1549) was the Prince of Lüneburg from 1520 to 1527 and Baron of Harburg from 1527 to 1549.

Otto III, Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg, Lord of Harburg( 20 March 1572 in Harburg – 4 August 1641 in Harburg) was a titular Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg and ruler of the apanage Brunswick- Harburg.

Albert of Saxe-Wittenberg (died 28 June 1385 in Wittenberg) was born as the son of Otto (d. 30 March 1350), a younger son of the prince-elector Rudolf I of Saxe-Wittenberg, and his (Otto's) wife Elisabeth, daughter of Duke William II of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1370 he succeeded his (maternal) grandfather as the Duke or Prince of Lüneburg. William II of Brunswick-Lüneburg named his grandson Albert as his heir in Lüneburg because neither he or his brother had male heirs. In fact William II had previously asked Emperor Charles IV for the eventual enfeoffment of the state to his grandson, but backed away again in the years that followed, because he feared the influence of Albert's uncles, Wenceslas I and Rudolf II. A further reason may be found in the terms of the Brunswick-Lüneburg investiture agreement of 1235 as well as the succession treaties agreed by William's father Otto the Strict with Brunswick-Lüneburg's Wolfenbüttel line of the House of Welf, according to which the principality had to be passed to any male heir within the entire Welf house if there were one. After the death of William II and the succession of the Wolfenbüttel Magnus II, the Lüneburg War of Succession broke out between Saxe-Wittenberg and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Albert was backed by his uncle the Prince-Elector Wenceslas of Saxony (Saxe-Wittenberg). On 25 July 1373, Duke Magnus was killed in a battle near Leveste on the Deister (part of modern-day Gehrden). After this an arrangement was agreed between Prince-Elector Wenceslas and Albert, on the one hand and the widow of Magnus II and her sons on the other. It was agreed that the land would belong, undivided, to the two Ascanians from Saxe-Wittenberg and, after their deaths, would be transferred to the sons of the fallen duke, Magnus II. And that it should continue to alternate after the deaths of the Welfs, i.e. the succession would pass to the Ascanians again. In order that this plan could also be reinforced by family ties, in 1374 Albert of Saxe-Lüneburg married the widow of Magnus II, Catharina and chose Celle as his home, which he made a residence in 1378. The two still underage sons of Magnus also married into the House of Ascania in 1386. He would rule the Principality of Lüneburg jointly with his uncle Wenceslas until his death on 28 June 1385.

Allegheny Uprising (released in the UK as The First Rebel) is an American 1939 film directed by William A. Seiter and starring Claire Trevor and John Wayne. Based on the 1937 novel The First Rebel by Neil H. Swanson, with a screenplay by the film's producer, P. J. Wolfson, the film is loosely based on the historical event known as the Black Boys Rebellion of 1765, after the conclusion of the French and Indian War. It was produced by RKO Pictures.

The supporting cast includes Brian Donlevy, George Sanders and Chill Wills. Claire Trevor and John Wayne also headed the cast of John Ford's Stagecoach the same year, and in Allegheny Uprising Trevor is top-billed over Wayne, due to her greater name value at the time. The film did not fare well in its initial release. The superficially similar John Ford film Drums Along the Mohawk had been released only one week prior. In the United Kingdom, where the film kept the original title, it was initially banned by the Ministry of Information for placing the British, already at war against Nazi Germany, in a bad light.

Where was the place of burial of Pareherwenemef's mother?",deir el-medina egypt,qv66,0.043629564344882965,0.0,False
601,"Isetnofret was an Ancient Egyptian woman and daughter of the high priest of Ptah and king's son Khaemweset( lived around 1200 BC). She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called daughter of his body. On a relief found at Saqqara she is called his beloved daughter and king's daughter. Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the noble woman Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.

Mutnedjmet was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 21st dynasty. She was the Great Royal Wife of her brother, Psusennes I. It is generally assumed that she was the mother of Pharaoh Amenemope but, since genealogical evidence is lacking, this is primarily based on the fact that he succeeded to the throne. That she was the mother of the Crown Prince Ramesses-Ankhefenmut has been challenged an now seems unlikely. She was the daughter of High Priest of Amun Pinedjem I, who was the de facto ruler of Southern Egypt from 1070 BCE onwards, then proclaimed himself pharaoh in 1054 BCE. Her mother was Duathathor-Henuttawy, a daughter of Ramesses XI, last ruler of the 20th dynasty. Three of her brothers succeeded each other as High Priests of Amun and a sister, Maatkare became God's Wife of Amun. She was buried in the Tanis tomb of her husband, in a burial chamber parallel to his. Her burial chamber was later usurped by king Amenemope, but her name and some of her titles survived, mainly on the side of the sarcophagus which was turned to the wall. Pierre Montet believes that a depiction of Mutnedjmet on the wall of the burial chamber may have been usurped and reworked into a goddess when turning the scene into a depiction of Amenemope turned out to be too much work. The present whereabouts of her mummy remain unknown, but around 1980 some bronze ushabtis of her have surfaced on the antiquitites market which suggests that her alternative burial (or a deposit of funerary equipment) may have been discovered. Several burial items are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Her titles were: King's Daughter of His Body; King's Sister; Great Royal Wife; Lady of the Two Lands; Second Prophet of Amun in Tanis.

Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30–35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.

Akhethetep was an ancient Egyptian official of the Old Kingdom, who is known from his burial at Giza, excavated 1929/ 1930 by the Egyptian Egyptologist Selim Hassan. Akhethetep had several rather modest titles, including ka- priest of the king's motherscribe of the treasury or inspector of the scribes of the granary. He was also inspector of scribes at Akhet- Khufu. Akhet- Khufu is the pyramid of king Khufu. His wife was a woman called Nikauhathor. In his tomb are also mentioned on a false door a certain Kainefer and a woman called Peseshet. The latter with the title overseer of the physicians, perhaps the first female doctor known by name. The relationship of these two people to Akhethetep is unknown. Selim Hassan wonders whether they were his parents. Akhethetep was buried in a mastaba, that was partly carved into the rocks, partly built of stones. Only some parts of the inner rooms were decorated and inscribed. The exact dating of Akhethetep is uncertain.

Raymundo Gleyzer (September 25, 1941, Buenos Aires - missing since May 27, 1976) was an Argentine political filmmaker. He specialized in documentaries. He was disappeared as an opponent of the military dictatorship, and most likely murdered. Born into a Jewish family, Gleyzer became interested in politics and film early on. All his films he put into the service of the fight against social injustice and for the revolution. He made his first film in the backward northeast of Brazil, where he barely escaped imminent death. In the early 1970s he made a film in Mexico about the so-called institutionalized revolution of the PRI ruling party. The film was banned in Argentina at first, but found a lively echo in Mexico among the students. In 1973 he co-founded the Cine de la Base group, which organized demonstrations and discussions with workers (i.e. outside the cinema industry). His last major film, Los traidores (The Traitors), presents his critique of the Peronist political movement, which played an important role in Argentina in 1973. The film depicts how union leaders have allied themselves with entrepreneurs, the military and the US to maintain their personal power and enrich themselves.

He is thus one of the tens of thousands of desaparecidos (disappeared) of the Argentine military dictatorship, most of which were secretly murdered. Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff created a cartoon dedicated to Gleyzer and the violently disappeared people of Latin America.

Structured as a B film, the production did not engage any stars who would receive billing above the title, relying instead on a quartet of veteran character actors, Charles Winninger, Maria Ouspenskaya, C. Aubrey Smith and Harry Carey, second-tier young leads Richard Carlson and Jean Parker as well as other woman Helen Vinson, a minor lead/second lead during early and mid thirties, here approaching the end of her career. All seven actors received a Featuring billing after the title. The remaining supporting cast included Rod La Rocque, a top leading man of the silent era, now reduced to playing minor supporting roles. Because the events of the plot take place during the Christmas season, it is a contemporary but little-remembered example of the Christmas film. The original print has been digitally remastered and preserved by the National Film Museum, Incorporated.

The General Died at Dawn is a 1936 American drama film that tells the story of a mercenary who meets a beautiful girl while trying to keep arms from getting to a vicious warlord in war-torn China. The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham Two-Gun Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China. This is reported to be the first film to use foam latex prosthetics. Makeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors. John Howard Reid called it one of the fifty finest films Hollywood ever made.

Princess Maria- Olympia of Greece and Denmark( born 25 July 1996) is an American fashion model, socialite and member of the Greek royal family. She is the oldest child and only daughter of Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece and his wife, Marie- Chantal Miller. Her paternal grandparents are Constantine II of Greece and Anne- Marie of Denmark, who were the last King and Queen of the Hellenes, while her maternal grandfather is duty free entrepreneur Robert Warren Miller. She is currently sixth in the line of succession to the former throne of Greece, after her father and brothers.

Alexandra of Greece and Denmark (25 March 1921 – 30 January 1993) was, by marriage to King Peter II, the last Queen of Yugoslavia. Posthumous daughter of King Alexander of Greece and his morganatic wife Aspasia Manos , Alexandra was not part of the Greek royal family until July 1922, when at the behest of Queen Sophia, a law was passed which retroactively recognized marriages of members of the royal family, although on a non-dynastic basis; in consequence, she obtained the style and name of Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. At the same time, a serious political and military crisis, linked to the defeat of Greece against Turkey in Anatolia, gradually led to the deposition and exile of the royal family, beginning in 1924. Being the only members of the dynasty allowed to remain in the country by the Second Hellenic Republic, the princess and her mother later found refuge in Italy, with Dowager Queen Sophia. After three years with her paternal grandmother, Alexandra left Florence to continue her studies in the United Kingdom, while her mother settled in Venice. Separated from her mother, the princess fell ill, forcing Aspasia to make her leave the boarding school where she was studying. After the restoration of her uncle, King George II, on the Hellenic throne in 1935, Alexandra stayed in her native country several times but the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War, in 1940, forcing her and her mother to settle in Athens. The invasion of Greece by the Axis powers in April–May 1941, however, led to their moving to the United Kingdom. Again exiled, Alexandra met in London the young King Peter II of Yugoslavia, who also went into exile after the invasion of his country by the Germans. Quickly, Alexandra and Peter II fell in love and planned to marry. Opposition from both Peter's mother, Maria, and the Yugoslav government in exile forced the couple to delay their marriage plans until 1944, when they finally celebrated their wedding. A year later, Alexandra gave birth to her only son, Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia. However, the happiness of the family was short-lived: on 29 November 1945, Marshal Tito proclaimed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Alexandra, who had never set foot in her adopted country, was left without a crown. The abolition of the Yugoslav monarchy had very serious consequences for the royal couple. Penniless and unable to adapt to the role of citizen, Peter II turned to alcoholism and multiple affairs with other women. Depressed by the behaviour of her husband, Alexandra neglected her son and made several suicide attempts. After the death of Peter II in 1970, Alexandra's health continued to deteriorate. She died of cancer in 1993 and her remains were buried in the Royal Cemetery Plot in the park of Tatoi in Greece, before being transferred to the Royal Mausoleum of Oplenac in 2013.

The drumming troupe's success then led to the opening of an ice cream store in 2010, which also brings together people from both sides of the genocide.

Miriam Bale wrote in her New York Times review, When viewers are facing the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda, in which hundreds of thousands of Tutsis were slaughtered in 1994, it ’s easy to think that ice cream is a comparatively petty concern. But, thankfully, the sibling directors Lisa and Rob Fruchtman have made a nuanced and deftly edited film about a complex issue. Scott Foudras wrote in Variety Although the 1994 genocide and its aftermath have been explored extensively in both narrative and nonfiction films over the past decade( especially documentarian Anne Aghion ’s remarkable suite of films culminating in 2009 ’s My Neighbor My KillerSweet Dreams nevertheless forges its own path, dwelling less on the violent crimes of the past than on the small but meaningful ways in which a once- divided people are working to rebuild the social and psychological health of their country.

Which country Æthelwald, Ealdorman Of East Anglia's wife is from?",france,english,0.2660978436470032,0.0,False
632,"Æthelwald (died 962) was ealdorman of East Anglia. He is mentioned in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester along with other members of his family. He was probably the oldest son of Æthelstan Half-King and succeeded to some of his father's offices in 956 when Æthelstan became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. He was a benefactor of Ramsey Abbey and a supporter of the Benedictine reform movement which began in the reign of King Edgar. He was the first husband of Ælfthryth who married King Edgar after Æthelwald's death. William of Malmesbury's Gesta regum anglorum has a late account of Æthelwald's marriage and death. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter Ælfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent Æthelwald to see Ælfthryth, ordering him to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report.  When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, Æthelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this deception, and decided to repay Æthelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed Æthelwald. He asked Ælfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed Æthelwald during a hunt. Edward Augustus Freeman debunks the Æthelwald murder story as a tissue of romance in his Historic essays, but his arguments were in turn refuted by the naturalist William Henry Hudson in his 1920 book Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn. Æthelwald was seemingly dead by 962 as he ceases to witness charters at that time. He was buried at Ramsey Abbey. His younger brother Æthelwine succeeded to his offices. A memorial to Æthelwald, known as the Dead Man's Plack, was erected in Longparish, Hampshire in 1825.

Eleanor of Castile (1241 – 28 November 1290) was an English queen consort, the first wife of Edward I, whom she married as part of a political deal to affirm English sovereignty over Gascony. The marriage was known to be particularly close, and Eleanor travelled extensively with her husband. She was with him on the Ninth Crusade, when he was wounded at Acre, but the popular story of her saving his life by sucking out the poison has long been discredited. When she died, at Harby near Lincoln, her grieving husband famously ordered a stone cross to be erected at each stopping-place on the journey to London, ending at Charing Cross. Eleanor was better educated than most medieval queens and exerted a strong cultural influence on the nation. She was a keen patron of literature, and encouraged the use of tapestries, carpets and tableware in the Spanish style, as well as innovative garden designs. She was also a successful businesswoman, endowed with her own fortune as Countess of Ponthieu.

His songs criticized the ruling communist regime and appealed to the tradition of patriotic resistance within Poles. He remains best known for his protest songs on social and political subjects (MuryWalls) based on L'Estaca by Lluís Llach, ObawaWolf hunt (lit. Raid))). However, he was more a poet than a political singer, and his texts have not lost their relevance with the demise of the Soviet union and its communist bloc. He made his debut in 1977 at the Student Song Festival, where he was awarded firstprize for his work ObawaWolf hunt (lit. Raid)) based on song    by Vladimir Vysotsky.

However, Kaczmarski was soon disillusioned by the developments in Poland after 1989 and eventually emigrated to Australia. Kaczmarski was known not only for his politically motivated lyrics but also for his characteristically dynamic – even aggressive – classical guitar playing, and expressive performance style. His deep knowledge of not only his nation's history but also of classical literature gave his songs a particularly deep and multi-layered resonance (e.g. Powtórka z Odysei, recalled Homer's Odyssey, while the ballad Lalka masterfully retells Boleslaw Prus's second novel of the same name, The Doll.). He often performed before contrastingly different audiences: groups of friends in their homes, campus venues, and large concert halls in Poland, the rest of Europe and America. Kaczmarski was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 2002. He died in a hospital in Gdask in 2004.

Alain Resnais( 3 June 19221 March 2014) was a French film director and screenwriter whose career extended over more than six decades. After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s, he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog( 1956), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps. Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour( 1959), Last Year at Marienbad( 1961), and Muriel( 1963), all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past. These films were contemporary with, and associated with, the French New Wave( la nouvelle vague), though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement. He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left- wing politics. He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe- Grillet, Jorge Semprún and Jacques Sternberg. In later films, Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms, including theatre, music, and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song. His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness, memory, and the imagination, and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives. Throughout his career, he won many awards from international film festivals and academies.

659,"Fernando Rodríguez de Castro (died 1304), was a Galician noble and a member of the House of Castro. He was the son of Esteban Fernández de Castro, Lord of Lemos and Sarria, and Alzonza Rodríguez de León. His paternal grandparents were Fernando Gutiérrez de Castro and Emilia Iniguez de Mendoza. His maternal grandparents were Rodrigo Alfonso de León, son of Alfonso IX of León, and Ines Rodríguez Cabrera. Following the death of his father, Esteban Fernández de Castro, Fernando became Lord of Lemos and Sarria. In 1293, he married Violante Sánchez of Castile, illegitimate daughter of Sancho IV of Castile. He was one of the most powerful and influential nobles of Galicia, like most members of the House of Castro. In 1304, Fernando took up arms against Ferdinand IV of Castile, by attacking Philip of Castile, who was in Galicia besieging the fortress of Monforte de Lemos. Fernando's advisers tried to persuade him to reach a peace agreement with the Felipe, who was brother of Violente Sánchez of Castile, his wife. However, no agreement was reached and Fernando Rodriguez de Castro was killed in the ensuing battle.

Fernando Rodríguez (or Fernán Ruiz) de Castro  (1125–1185) was a Castilian nobleman, statesman and military leader who made his career in León. He was the leader of the House of Castro during the civil wars that followed the death of Sancho III of Castile and the succession of the infant Alfonso VIII. He was nicknamed el Castellano (the Castilian) in León and el Leonés (the Leonese) in Castile. Fernando was the eldest son of Rodrigo Fernández de Castro and his wife, Eilo Álvarez. He led the Castro family in their dispute with the House of Lara over the custody and regency of the young Alfonso VIII after Sancho III's death in August 1158. Early in 1160 the Laras managed to exile him to the court of Ferdinand II of León. He returned to Castile in March with an army and defeated the Laras at the Battle of Lobregal, where his erstwhile father-in-law, Osorio Martínez, was killed fighting alongside his enemies, and Nuño Pérez de Lara was captured. Nonetheless, he was unable to reestablish himself in his homeland. Shortly after 1160, with a mixed force of Christians and Muslims, Fernando besieged the recently founded city of Ciudad Rodrigo. Ferdinand II, with the militias of Salamanca and Zamora, came to its relief. Fernando was soon reconciled to the king of León, who appointed him governor first of Cuéllar, Dueñas, Salamanca, Toro, Valladolid, and Zamora, and later of Asturias and Benavente. He served Ferdinand II as majordomo, the highest court official in power, on two occasions: between 15 August 1162 and 6 September 1164 and between 19 October 1165 and 15 May 1166. In 1162 Ferdinand II conquered Toledo from Castile and placed it in the hands of Fernando Rodríguez as governor. Toledo remained a Leonese possession until 1166. In 1164 Fernando returned to Castile a second time with an army and killed Manrique Pérez de Lara in the Battle of Huete (June/July). In 1168 he was appointed alcalde in the city of León, and controlled the city's fortifications (tenente turris Legionisheld the towers of León) until 1182. In the early summer of 1169, the Portuguese freebooter Gerald the Fearless took the city of Badajoz after a long siege, but the garrison took refuge in the alcazaba, the siege of which continued. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region at the expense of both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve Gerald. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of León, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison. Fernando Rodríguez, then majordomo, was one of the Leonese leaders on this expedition. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Fernando captured Gerald. After the mêlée the Leonese had control of the town and the alcazaba, which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom. Ferdinand retained Cáceres, but Trujillo, Montánchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfragüe he gave to Fernando Ruiz. Fernando thus established a semi-independent lordship between the Tagus and Guadiana rivers, with his seat at Trujillo. In 1171 he was granted the infantaticum of León. Between 1172 and 1175 Fernando held Mayorga and Melgar de Arriba from the Crown, both had been fiefs of Osorio Martínez. He was for the remainder of his career a frequent attendee at both the Leonese and Castilian courts. The Annales compostellani record Fernando's death in the year 1185, sometime after August 16.

During the Castilian Civil War, he was the leading partisan of Peter's camp, and continued fighting for the Petrist cause against the House of Trastámara even after the king's death in 1369. His first marriage in 1354 to Juana Alfonso, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso XI of Castile, produced two children: Divorced from his first wife, in 1367 he married Eleanor Enriquez, Lady of Melgar, widow of Alonso de Guzmán and daughter of Enrique Enriquez and his wife, Urraca Ponce de Leon.

She was the only daughter of Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo and his wife, whose name and origins are unknown; her brother, Wadysaw the White, was later a candidate for the Polish throne. By 1323, King Charles I of Hungary wanted to increase influence over Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia. He offered Stephan the hand of Elizabeth, the relative of his own Piast wife Elizabeth.

The marriage was celebrated by 1339. Up to 1339, Stephan was married to an unknown Bulgarian princess.

687,"Half Mile Lagoon is a lake in the Northland Region of New Zealand. It is located 5 km to the northwest of Ngataki. Half Mile Lagoon once covered an area of 36000 square metres, however the largest of the remaining pools was only approximately 100 square metres( when surveyed in 2005). This area is an example of decreasing water levels which have impacted on many of the smaller dune lakes on the Aupouri Pensinsula. Half Mile Lagoon lies directly adjacent to the Aupouri pine forest, and much of the catchment land use is pastoral.

Lake Waitaki is the smallest, oldest and farthest downstream of the three man-made lakes of the Waitaki hydroelectric project in New Zealand's South Island. It lies below lakes Aviemore and Benmore on the Waitaki River, close to the town of Kurow. It is part of the traditional boundary of the Canterbury and Otago regions( although the official border has been moved southward to include the entire lake, as well as the entire northwest portion of Waitaki District within the Canterbury Region. The lake is created by Waitaki Dam, a 36 m high spill weir dam built between 1928 and 1934. The Waitaki power station has an installed capacity of 105 MW. Waitaki was the last dam built in New Zealand with excavation done with pick and shovel, not heavy machinery. The power station is to be upgraded by Meridian Energy between 2011 and 2016 at a projected cost of$ NZ 60- 80 million.

Lake Waikareiti, also spelt Lake Waikare Iti, is located in Te Urewera National Park in the North Island of New Zealand. A number of hiking trails are found within the catchment basin of the lake. Its formation followed a landslide 18,000 years ago, in which a part of the landmass of 10 kilometers wide slid to the north- west. It is four kilometres to the northeast of the larger Lake Waikaremoana, into which it drains via the Aniwaniwa Stream. The smaller lake's surface is at an altitude of 880 metres above sea level- considerably higher than that of Waikaremoana- and as such the stream has several fine waterfalls such as the Aniwaniwa Falls and Mokau Falls. Several small islets are found in the lake. One of these, Rahui, itself contains a tiny lake- one of New Zealand's very rare lakes within lakes. Numerous flora species are found within the lake catchment basin, crown fern( Blechnum discolor) being a widespread understory plant. An assortment of birds found in the North Island are present at the national park except for the weka.

Lake Waikaremoana is located in Te Urewera in the North Island of New Zealand, 60 kilometres northwest of Wairoa and 80 kilometres west-southwest of Gisborne. It covers an area of . From the Maori Waikaremoana translates as 'sea of rippling waters' The lake lies in the heart of Tuhoe country. The hamlet of Aniwaniwa and the Waikaremoana Holiday Park are located on the lakeshore, along SH38 (from Wai-O-Tapu via Murupara to Wairoa), which connects the lake to the central North Island (Rotorua) and Gisborne. There is a Department of Conservation office at Aniwaniwa. Several walks start here, including a short stroll to Aniwaniwa Falls. The village of Onepoto is located on the lake's southern shores, close to the lake's old overflow channel and the intake of the Waikaremoana hydroelectric power scheme. The name Onepoto means short beach , and refers to the small bay to the north of the village with a beach only 60 metres long. Lake Waikaremoana is a holiday destination for people who use the lake for fishing, tramping and other recreational activities. The Lake Waikaremoana Track, one of New Zealand's Great Walks, is a three- to four-day tramp which follows approximately half of the lake's circumference. The track can be walked independently, or as part of a guided group. There are huts dotted on the walk which require booking to use. Camping is permitted unless you are more than 500 metres from the track. The climate of the area is temperate In the summer and cool during the winters, snowfalls occur a few times a year in the region. Numbers of visitors to the area are limited to some extent as a result of the extensive unsealed road that must be taken to reach it. This makes Lake Waikaremoana significantly less congested with tourists than the other nine Great Walks in New Zealand. The smaller Lake Waikareiti lies four kilometres to the northeast.

Mokohinau Islands Lighthouse is a lighthouse on Burgess Island, one of the Mokohinau Islands, which lie of the northeast coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It is owned and operated by Maritime New Zealand. The lighthouse sits at the entrance to the Hauraki Gulf as the landfall light for vessels approaching Auckland from the north and northeast. The lighthouse was built in 1883 and first lit during June of that year. Its isolated position, approximately 50 km northeast of Cape Rodney makes it one of the most distant lighthouses from the mainland. During World War II, the lighthouse was turned off as the German destroyer suspected to be in the area laying mines. The lighthouse was not relit until 1947. In 1980, the lighthouse was fully automated and the lighthouse keepers were withdrawn. The lighthouse is now monitored remotely from Wellington. The white light flashes every 10 seconds and can be seen for 19 nautical miles( 35 km).

Robert II de Brus, le Meschin (the Cadet) (fl. 1138 , died or 1194), was a 12th-century Norman noble and 2nd Lord of Annandale. He was the son, perhaps the second son, of Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale. The elder de Brus' allegiances were compromised when David I invaded England in the later 1130s, and he had renounced his fealty to David before the Battle of the Standard in 1138. The younger Robert however remained loyal and took over his father's land in Scotland, whilst the English territories remained with the elder Robert and passed to the latter's elder son Adam de Brus, 2nd Lord of Skelton. Bruce family tradition has it that Robert II was captured by his father at the battle and given over to King Stephen of England. A legend tells that in the 1140s, Robert II was visited at Annan by St Malachy. St Malachy asked Robert to pardon a thief, but Robert hanged him anyway, and for this the River Annan destroyed part of his castle and the de Brus line received a curse from the holy man. Robert made Lochmaben the centre of his lordship and constructed a new caput there. He married Euphemia, daughter of Sir Adam de Crosebi or Crosbj of Albemarle (b c1098), and Cecily FitzDuncan (b c1113). They had five known children: Robert was buried at Gisborough Priory in the North Riding, Yorkshire, England, a monastery founded by his father Robert I de Brus. As his eldest son, Robert, predeceased him, he was succeeded by his second son William.

William de Brus, 3rd Lord of Annandale (died 16 July 1212), was the second but eldest surviving son of Robert de Brus, 2nd Lord of Annandale. His elder brother, Robert III de Brus, predeceased their father, never holding the lordship of Annandale. William de Brus thus succeeded his father when the latter died in 1194. William de Brus possessed large estates in the north of England. He obtained from John, King of England, the grant of a weekly market at Hartlepool, and granted lands to the canons of Gisburn. Very little else is known about William's activities. He makes a few appearances in the English government records and witnessed a charter of William the Lion, King of Scotland. He married a woman called Christina, and had by her at least two sons and one daughter:

Nigel de Brus (c. 1279 – September 1306) was a younger brother of King Robert I. Born at Carrick, Ayrshire, Scotland, he was a son of Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale and Margaret, Countess Of Carrick. He supported his older brother in the struggle for the crown of Scotland and fought in the Wars of Scottish Independence. In 1306, he was captured by English forces at Kildrummy Castle, where he and his garrison held off Edward's forces who had been seeking Robert the Bruce's wife Elizabeth, daughter Marjorie, sisters Mary and Christina, and Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan. Their actions enabled the women to escape, although the women were soon captured and betrayed to the English by William, 3rd Earl of Ross in the chapel of St Duthac at Tain in Ross. After his capture he was executed for high treason by being hanged, drawn, and quartered in September 1306 at Berwick-upon-Tweed.

The second son of the 26th king Seong, he assumed the throne after the death of his older brother and 27th king Wideok, but reigned only briefly before his own death. The Samguk Yusa describes him as the son of Wideok, but this is considered an error. His reign saw major inroads from the neighbouring Silla and Goguryeo kingdoms, with Silla occupying the present-day Seoul area and trading directly with China. Baekje's commercial positions along the Yellow Sea coast were now dominated by Goguryeo, trading outposts in China were lost to the Sui Dynasty's unification, and Japan's political centralization outgrew Baekje's influence as well. The decline of external commerce and influence led to infighting among the nobility. He was succeeded by his son Beop.

Gaero of Baekje (?–475, 455–475) was the 21st king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the eldest son of the 20th king Biyu. He died in battle as Baekje's capital in the present-day Seoul region fell to the northern rival kingdom Goguryeo.

Wideok of Baekje (525–598) (r. 554–598) was the 27th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the eldest son of King Seong, and rose to the throne upon his father's death.

The General Died at Dawn is a 1936 American drama film that tells the story of a mercenary who meets a beautiful girl while trying to keep arms from getting to a vicious warlord in war-torn China. The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham Two-Gun Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China.

Malick's films have been noted for exploring themes such as individual transcendence, nature, and conflicts between reason and instinct. They are typically marked by broad philosophical and spiritual overtones, as well as the use of meditative voice-overs from individual characters. The stylistic elements of the director's work have inspired divided opinions among film scholars and audiences; some praised his films for their cinematography and aesthetics, while others found them lacking in plot and character development. His first five films have nonetheless ranked highly in retrospective decade-end and all-time polls.

Luis Buñuel Portolés( 22 February 1900 – 29 July 1983) was a Spanish- born Mexican filmmaker who worked in France, Mexico and Spain. When Buñuel died at age 83, his obituary in The New York Times called him an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant- garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later. His first picture, Un Chien Andalou —made in the silent era—was called the most famous short film ever made by critic Roger Ebert, and his last film, That Obscure Object of Desire —made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics.

She was baptized as Judith, but was commonly called Jutta or Guta. Sometimes the Latinate form Clementia was used, or Claritia or Claricia.

Judith of Bavaria, Duchess of Swabia( 19 May 1100 – 27 Aug 1130) was a Duchess of Swabia by marriage to Frederick II, Duke of Swabia. She was the mother of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, known to history as Barbarossa.

She was the only daughter of Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo and his wife, whose name and origins are unknown; her brother, Wadysaw the White, was later a candidate for the Polish throne. By 1323, King Charles I of Hungary wanted to increase influence over Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia. He offered Stephan the hand of Elizabeth, the relative of his own Piast wife Elizabeth. By marrying Elizabeth of Kuyavia, Stephen received from Charles the lands to the west formerly held by Mladen I Šubi of Bribir and Usora and Soli in the north formerly held by Vladislav, King of Syrmia. The marriage was celebrated by 1339. Up to 1339, Stephan was married to an unknown Bulgarian princess. The only child which can be attributed to Elizabeth of Kuyavia without doubt is Elizabeth of Bosnia, born c. 1340. Some believe that Catherine of Bosnia, Countess of Cilli, was daughter of Elizabeth of Kuyavia and Stephen II, while others argue that Catherine was daughter of Stephen II's brother Vladislaus and his wife Jelena Šubi. Elizabeth may have also had a son, Vuk who may have survived infancy but he did not outlive his father so never became Ban of Bosnia. Vuk may have been the son of one of Stephen's previous two wives. Stephen outlived Elizabeth. It is unknown what Elizabeth died of. Judging by the time, it is possible that she died of Black Death, which was sweeping across Europe during the 14th century. Banness Elizabeth was buried in Bobovac in a tomb which she shared with her husband, brother- in- law Vladislaus and sister- in- law Jelena. After Elizabeth of Kuyavia's death, her daughter Elizabeth was fostered by the Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth and this soon led to Elizabeth's marriage to Louis I of Hungary.

As time went by, Alfredson more or less totally turned around to become a serious author and film director. In 1982 he both directed and participated in the film The Simple- Minded Murderer, a motion picture based on his own novel En ond man An evil man).

Wong Kar-wai (born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama  As Tears Go By (1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles.  Days of Being Wild (1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express (1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

It was originally supposed to star Chuck Norris but he backed out when filming was delayed by funding problems and his son, Mike Norris, landed the lead instead. A Finnish production, this was at that time the most expensive film ever to have been made in Finland. The Finnish Board of Film Classification first banned the movie, because of excessive violence and anti-Soviet elements. Because of that the movie had to be shortened 3.5 minutes before it was finally accepted for distribution October 29, 1986 with the Supreme Court decision. The premiere was December 19, 1986.

Irving Berlin (born Israel Isidore Beilin; ; May 11, 1888 – September 22, 1989) was an American composer and lyricist, widely considered one of the greatest songwriters in American history. His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook. Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, Marie from Sunny Italy, in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and had his first major international hit, Alexander's Ragtime Band in 1911. He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. It is commonly believed that Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp using his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever. Alexander's Ragtime Band sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania.  Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to reach the heart of the average American, whom he saw as the real soul of the country. In doing so, said Walter Cronkite, at Berlin's 100th birthday tribute, he helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives. He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including Alexander's Ragtime BandEaster ParadePuttin' on the RitzCheek to CheekWhite ChristmasHappy HolidayAnything You Can Do (I Can Do Better), and There's No Business Like Show Business. His Broadway musical and 1943 film This is the Army, with Ronald Reagan, had Kate Smith singing Berlin's God Bless America which was first performed in 1938. Berlin's songs have reached the top of the charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers including The Andrews Sisters, Perry Como, Eddie Fisher, Al Jolson, Fred Astaire, Ethel Merman, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Rosemary Clooney, Cher, Diana Ross, Bing Crosby, Sarah Vaughan, Ruth Etting, Fanny Brice, Marilyn Miller, Rudy Vallée, Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Doris Day, Jerry Garcia, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Buble, Lady Gaga, and Christina Aguilera. Berlin died in 1989 at the age of 101. Composer Douglas Moore sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, and includes him instead with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, and Carl Sandburg, as a great American minstrel—someone who has caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe. Composer George Gershwin called him the greatest songwriter that has ever lived, and composer Jerome Kern concluded that Irving Berlin has no place in American music—he is American music.

Alexander de Renzy( August 13, 1935 – June 8, 2001) was an American director and producer of pornographic movies. Born in New York City, de Renzy served in the United States Air Force as a Survival Instructor. Back in the United States, he began making documentary films in San Francisco. In October 1969, he went to Denmark to attend Sex 69, the first porn trade show hosted in Copenhagen after the legalization of adult pornography there.

He churned out adult video quickies, shooting over 200 hardcore videos, with a special emphasis on anal sex. Alex de Renzy suffered a fatal stroke and diabetic attack while in his hotel room in Los Angeles during the production of his last video.

David Wark Griffith( January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948) was an American film director. Widely considered as the most important filmmaker of his generation, he pioneered the feature- length movie and many enduring cinematic techniques, such as the close- up. His film The Birth of a Nation( 1915) broke box- office records but also attracted much controversy, as it depicted African Americans in a negative light and glorified the Ku Klux Klan.  Intolerance( 1916) was made as an answer to his critics. Several of Griffith's later films were also successful, including Broken Blossoms( 1919), Way Down East( 1920), and Orphans of the Storm( 1921), but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of his final feature, The Struggle( 1931). Together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, he founded United Artists, enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios. Griffith was a founder member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Taxi! is a 1932 American pre-Code gangster film directed by Roy Del Ruth and starring James Cagney and Loretta Young. The film includes two famous Cagney dialogues, one of which features Cagney conducting a conversation with a passenger in Yiddish, and the other when Cagney is speaking to his brother's killer through a locked closet, Come out and take it, you dirty yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door! The provenance of this sequence led to Cagney being famously misquoted as saying, You dirty rat, you killed my brother. To play his competitor in a ballroom dance contest, Cagney recommended his pal, fellow tough-guy-dancer George Raft, who was uncredited in the film. In a lengthy and memorable sequence, the scene culminates with Raft and his partner winning the dance contest against Cagney and Young, after which Cagney slugs Raft and knocks him down. As in The Public Enemy (1931), several scenes in Taxi! involved the use of live machine gun bullets. After a few of the bullets narrowly missed Cagney's head, he outlawed the practice in his future films. In the film they see a fictitious Warner Bros. movie at the cinema called Her Hour of Love in which Cagney cracks a joke about the film's leading man's appearance (an unbilled cameo by Warners contract player Donald Cook, who had played Cagney's brother in The Public Enemy) saying, his ears are too big. Also advertised in the cinema lobby in the film is The Mad Genius, an actual film starring John Barrymore which was released the previous year by Warners and is a plug by them.

Frank Ripploh (September 2, 1949 – June 24, 2002) was a German actor, film director, and author. He is best remembered for his semi-autobiographical 1980 film Taxi zum Klo. The film, produced on a shoestring budget of 100,000 DM, explored the day-to-day life of a Berlin schoolteacher who also led a very active gay sex life. Extremely explicit for its day, and for some time afterward (to the point where the film was not passed uncut by the British Board of Film Classification until 2011), Taxi zum Klo was considered groundbreaking for the subject matter it portrayed, and achieved something of a cult status among gay audiences of the time. In 1987, Ripploh directed a sequel entitled Taxi nach Kairo, but the film was not considered as successful as its predecessor, and it was not released outside Germany. Ripploh also participated in the creation of a small number of other art house films during the 1980s, and had a role in the 1982 movie Querelle directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Ripploh died of cancer in 2002.

Murder Ahoy! is the last of four Miss Marple films made by Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer that starred Margaret Rutherford. As in the previous three, the actress plays Agatha Christie's amateur sleuth Miss Jane Marple, with Charles' Bud' Tingwell as( Chief) Inspector Craddock and Stringer Davis( Rutherford's real- life husband) playing Mr Stringer. The film was made in 1964 and directed by George Pollock, with David Pursall and Jack Seddon credited with the script. The music was by Ron Goodwin. Location shots included Denham Village and St Mawes, Cornwall. Unlike the previous three films that were adapted from Christie novels – The 4.50 from PaddingtonMurder, She Said – the only Miss Marple novel used), After the Funeral( a Poirot mystery, adapted for Miss Marple with the title Murder at the Gallop) and Mrs. McGinty's Dead( another Poirot novel, adapted as Murder Most Foul) – this film used an original screenplay that was not based on any of Christie's stories. It does, however, employ elements of the Miss Marple story They Do It With Mirrors. Specifically, the Battledore is a training ship for teenage boys with criminal tendencies, who are supposedly being set on the straight and narrow path – when, in fact, one of the members of the crew is training them for careers in housebreaking. Likewise, in They Do It With Mirrors, Lewis Serrocold is running his wife's mansion, Stonygates, as a boarding school for delinquent youths, to straighten out their lives – but, in fact, he is training selected students to hone their criminal skills, not to give them up. That is the only element borrowed into the film from a Christie story. There is also an entirely tongue- in- cheek reference to The Mousetrap, the Christie play that has been running continuously on the West End since 1952. Audiences who see The Mousetrap are asked to keep the ending a secret, so it is amusing when Rutherford's Miss Marple says that she's reading a rattling- good detective yarn and I hope I wo n't be giving too much away if I say the answer is a mousetrap! She then notes that she'll say no more – otherwise, I'll spoil it for you!

Harker's fiancée, Mina Murray, is staying with her friend Lucy Westenra, who is holidaying in Whitby. Lucy receives three marriage proposals from Dr. John Seward, Quincey Morris, and Arthur Holmwood (the son of Lord Godalming who later obtains the title himself).

Jehovah's Witnesses had its origins in the Bible Student movement, which developed in the United States in the 1870s among followers of Christian Restorationist minister Charles Taze Russell. Bible Student missionaries were sent to England in 1881 and the first overseas branch was opened in London in 1900. The group took on the name International Bible Students Association and by 1914 it was also active in Canada, Germany, Australia and other countries. The movement split into several rival organizations after Russell's death in 1916, with one -- led by Russell's successor, Joseph ``Judge ''Rutherford -- retaining control of both his magazine, The Watch Tower, and his legal and publishing corporation, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.

774,"Robert de Vere( after c. 1165 – before 25 October 1221), hereditary Master Chamberlain of England, was son of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, and Agnes of Essex. He succeeded his brother as the third Earl of Oxford, and was one of the twenty- five guarantors of Magna Carta. Robert de Vere was the second surviving son of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, and his third wife, Agnes of Essex. The date of his birth is not known, but he was likely born after 1164. Almost nothing is known of his life until 1207, when he married Isabel de Bolebec, the widow of Henry de Nonant( d.1206) of Totnes, Devon. In 1206- 7 Isabel and her sister Constance were co-heiresses of their niece, another Isabel de Bolebec, the countess of Oxford by her marriage to Robert's brother, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford. They divided the barony of Whitchurch. The fact that aunt and niece had identical names, Isabel de Bolbec, and were successively countesses of Oxford and heiresses of Whitchurch has led to confusion between the two women. When Robert's brother, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford, died in the latter half of 1214, Robert succeeded to his title and estates and the hereditary office of Master Chamberlain of England. The dower of Earl Aubrey's second wife, Alice( possibly his cousin, a daughter of Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk), had not been formalized. In 1215 Oxford settled his sister- in- law's dower by lot, the earl drawing two knights' fees for every one drawn by Alice. This is the only known instance of dower being settled in this manner. Oxford joined the disaffected barons who met at Stamford and forced King John to issue Magna Carta at Runnymede on 15 June 1215. The earl was elected one of the barons who were to guarantee the King's adherence to its terms. Together with other Magna Carta barons, he was excommunicated as a rebel by Pope Innocent III on 16 December 1215, and joined them in offering the crown to Prince Louis of France. Oxford took up arms against King John, but pledged loyalty to him after the King had taken Castle Hedingham in March 1216. Later in the same year, however, he did homage to Prince Louis at Rochester. Louis entered London and was proclaimed King. On 14 June 1216, he captured Winchester and soon controlled over half of England. In the midst of this crisis, King John died, prompting many of the barons to desert Louis in favor of John's nine- year- old son, Henry III. In 1217 Prince Louis retook Castle Hedingham and restored it to Oxford, but despite this Oxford transferred his allegiance to the new King in October 1217. Although he did homage to Henry, he was not fully restored in his offices and lands until February 1218. Earl Robert served as a king's justice in 1220- 21, and died shortly before 25 October 1221. He was buried at Hatfield Regis Priory, where either his son, Hugh de Vere, 4th Earl of Oxford, or his grandson, Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford had an effigy erected in which he is depicted in chain mail, cross- legged, pulling his sword from its scabbard and holding a shield displaying his de Vere arms.

Edward Charles Richard (Graf von) Taaffe (1898–1967), known as Richard, was an Austrian gemmologist who found the first cut and polished taaffeite in November 1945. He was the son of Count Henry Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe, an Austrian landowner and Maria Magda Fuchs, his grandfather the Austrian Prime Minister Eduard Taaffe. His father had once held hereditary titles from two different countries: he was a Count (Graf) of the Holy Roman Empire and a viscount in the Peerage of Ireland. Richard Taaffe, however, inherited neither the viscountcy, which was suspended by the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 in 1919, as his father had served on the Austrian side in World War I, nor the title of Count, as Austria had generally abolished titles of nobility in 1919. Taaffe was nonetheless almost always referred to in English-speaking countries as count. Taaffe grew up on the Bohemian estate of Ellischau, the family seat. For a short time, the composer Ralph Benatzky was his tutor. In the years after the First World War, Richard Taaffe emigrated to the Irish Free State and worked there as a gemmologist. In October 1945, he discovered the very rare mineral Taaffeite (Mg 3 Al 8 BeO 16, also known as Magnesiotaaffeite, 2N'2S), which was later named after him: Taaffe had a large number of old cut gems obtained from the Dublin jeweller Robert Dobbie, extracted from old jewellery. Upon close examination, Taaffe found that a spinel-derived purple stone originating from Sri Lanka had a birefringence that was absent in a spinel. Unable to explain this phenomenon, Taaffe sent the stone to B. W. Anderson in the London Chamber of Commerce's laboratory. After extensive analysis, it was finally recognized that the stone was an unidentified mineral, which was confirmed in 1949 by the discovery of a second specimen. With Richard Taaffe's death in 1967, no heirs to either title remained and both the Austrian and the Irish titles became extinct.

Jean Molinet( 1435 – 23 August 1507) was a French poet, chronicler, and composer. He is best remembered for his prose translation of Roman de la rose. Born in Desvres, which is now part of France, he studied in Paris. He entered the service of Charles, Duke of Burgundy from 1463, becoming secretary to Georges Chastellain; in 1464 he wrote La complainte de Grece, a political work presenting the Burgundian side in current affairs. He replaced Chastellain as historiographer in 1475, and he was also the librarian of Margaret of Austria. His chronicle covered the years 1474 to 1504, and was only published in 1828 after being edited by J. A. Buchon. It is considered inferior to Chastellain's chronicle, possessing less historical value. He was the head of a Burgundian school of poetry called the Grands Rhétoriqueurs, characterised by their excessive use of puns. His nephew Jean Lemaire de Belges spent some time with him at Valenciennes, and Lemaire considered himself a disciple of the elder writer. In 1501 he became canon of the church of Notre- Dame in Valenciennes, and he died there on 23 August 1507. Molinet was also a composer, although only one work, the rondeau Tart ara mon cueur sa plaisance, can be reliably attributed to him; however this work, an early chanson for four voices( most were for three) was extremely popular, as evidenced by the wide distribution of copies. He is also remembered for the elegy he wrote on the death of Johannes Ockeghem, Nymphes des bois, set by Josquin des Prez as part of his renowned motet La déploration sur la mort de Johannes Ockeghem. Of other contemporary composers, both Antoine Busnois and Loyset Compère carried on correspondence with him. Historian Johan Huizinga quotes some anti-clerical lines of Molinet's from a series of wishes for the New Year: Let us pray God that the Jacobins/ May eat the Augustinians,/ And that the Carmelites may be hanged/ With the cords of the Minorites.

Sir Aubrey (Hunt) de Vere, 2nd Baronet (28 August 1788 – 5 July 1846) was an Anglo-Irish poet and landowner. De Vere was the son of Sir Vere Hunt, 1st Baronet and Hon. Eleanor Pery, daughter of William Pery, 1st Baron Glentworth. He was educated at Harrow School, where he was a childhood friend of Lord Byron, and Trinity College, Dublin. He married Mary Spring Rice, the daughter of Stephen Edward Rice and Catherine Spring, and sister of Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon, in 1807. He succeeded to his father's title in 1818. The Hunt/de Vere family estate for 300 years (1657–1957), including the period of the de Vere Baronetcy of Curragh, is the present day Curraghchase Forest Park, in County Limerick. De Vere spent most of his life on the estate and was closely involved in its management. He suffered much trouble from his ownership of the island of Lundy, which his father, who was not much of a businessman, had unwisely purchased in 1802, and which became a heavy drain on the family's finances. Sir Vere was never able to find a purchaser for Lundy, and it took his son until 1834 to dispose of it. Sir Aubrey stood for election in the 1820 General Election and came in third with 2921 votes. He changed his surname from Hunt to de Vere in 1832, in reference to his Earl of Oxford ancestors, dating back to Aubrey de Vere I, a tenant-in-chief in England of William the Conqueror in 1086. He served as High Sheriff of County Limerick in 1811. Sir Aubrey was a poet. Wordsworth called his sonnets the most perfect of the age. These and his drama, Mary Tudor: An Historical Drama, were published by his son the poet Mr. Aubrey Thomas de Vere in 1875 and 1884.

Levine and Richard P. Levine, it was the second film based on a book by historian Cornelius Ryan to be adapted for the screen( after 1962's The Longest Day) and the second based on the events of World War II's failed Operation Market Garden( after 1946's Theirs is the Glory). The title originates with a disputed comment attributed to British Lieutenant General Frederick Browning, deputy commander of the First Allied Airborne Army, who told Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, the operation's architect, before the operation: I think we may be going a bridge too far. The comment was in reference to the intention of seizing the Arnhem bridgehead over the Rhine river—the culmination of a thrust into the occupied Netherlands which would allow the Allies to outflank German defences in order to end the war by Christmas of 1944.

A Matter of Life and Death is a 1946 British fantasy- romance film set in England during the Second World War. Written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the film stars David Niven, Roger Livesey, Raymond Massey, Kim Hunter and Marius Goring. The film was originally released in the United States under the title Stairway to Heaven, which derived from the film's most prominent special effect: a broad escalator linking Earth to the afterlife. The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications. They were filmed in Three- strip Technicolor, but colour was not added during printing, giving a pearly hue to the black and white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as Colour and Dye- Monochrome Processed in Technicolor. This reversed the effect in The Wizard of Oz. Photographic dissolves between Technicolor Dye- Monochrome( the Other World) and Three- Strip Technicolor( Earth) are used several times during the film. In 1999, A Matter of Life and Death placed 20th on the British Film Institute's list of Best 100 British films. In 2004, a poll by the magazine Total Film of 25 film critics named A Matter of Life and Death the second greatest British film ever made, behind Get Carter.

He was greatly influenced by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Shakespeare and Ibsen plays he had seen at the age of 12, and became a friend of director Max Reinhardt. During World War I he served as a company commander at the eastern front and was in the German air force, surviving several crashes without any severe injuries. One of Murnau's acclaimed works is the 1922 film Nosferatu, an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Although not a commercial success, owing to copyright issues with Stoker's novel, the film is considered a masterpiece of German Expressionist cinema. He later directed the 1924 film The Last Laugh, as well as a 1926 interpretation of Goethe's Faust. He later emigrated to Hollywood in 1926, where he joined the Fox Studio and made three films:  (1927), 4 Devils (1928) and City Girl (1930).  Sunrise has been regarded by critics and film directors as among the best films ever made. In 1931, Murnau travelled to Bora Bora to make the film  (1931) with documentary film pioneer Robert J. Flaherty, who left after artistic disputes with Murnau, who had to finish the movie on his own. A week prior to the opening of the film Tabu, Murnau died in a Santa Barbara hospital from injuries he had sustained in an automobile accident that occurred along the Pacific Coast Highway near Rincon Beach, southeast of Santa Barbara. Of the 21 films Murnau directed, eight are considered to be completely lost. One reel of his feature Marizza, genannt die Schmuggler-Madonna survives.

Each country gave undertakings to deliver certain elements of cast or crew. Disputes arose immediately. The American director bailed when his deposit failed to arrive. His agent, who was also mine, immediately slotted me in there, so within a day, the American producers, unbeknownst to me, offered their partners a replacement director: “the man who made the last Bruce Lee movie. ” I had in fact made a documentary about the late Bruce Lee, “The World of Kung Fu.” The Mexicans thought they were getting Enter the Dragon director, Robert Clouse. Their disappointment was palpable when this misrepresentation became clear on the first day of prep in Mexico City. Must say, my sphincter tightened a little too. I had arrived in a war zone.

Jean-Michel André Jarre (born 24 August 1948) is a French composer, performer and record producer. He is a pioneer in the electronic, ambient and new-age genres, and known for organising outdoor spectacles featuring his music, vast laser displays, large projections and fireworks. Jarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, jazz musicians and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales. His first mainstream success was the 1976 album Oxygène. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 12 million copies. Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician. As of 2004, Jarre had sold an estimated 80 million albums.

Appointed to the Lan Na throne by his father King Bayinnaung of Burma, Nawrahta dutifully contributed to his half-brother King Nanda's debilitating war effort against Siam (1584–95). He declared independence in 1597 after having defeated a 1595–96 invasion by Lan Xang on his own. From 1599 onward, he was forced to deal with a Lan Xang backed rebellion in Nan, and a Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai and Chiang Saen. He defeated the Chiang Rai rebellion in 1601–02 but was eventually forced to submit to Siam soon after. He defeated an invasion by Lan Xang in 1602–03, regaining Nan in the process. He ruled all of Lan Na, as a Siamese vassal, until his death.

Nawrahta of Kanni (also spelled) was a senior Myinsaing prince, who held important governorship positions in the rival Burmese-speaking kingdoms of Pinya and Sagaing. He was the youngest child of King Thihathu and his chief queen Mi Saw U, and the youngest brother of kings Uzana I and Kyawswa I of Pinya. Nawrahta was given the town of Shisha  in fief on 7 February 1313 by Thihathu. He remained loyal to his father's Pinya faction when the Myinsaing Kingdom split into Pinya and Sagaing kingdoms in 1315. He remained loyal to Pinya throughout the reigns of Uzana I and Sithu. On 29 March 1344, Kyawswa I succeeded the Pinya throne and appointed his younger brother Nawrahta governor of the important city of Pinle, their ancestral base. But two brothers became rivals, and in 1349, Nawrahta fled west to Sagaing where his nephew Nawrahta Minye had just become king. Nawrahta Minye appointed Nawrahta governor of Kanni. All royal chronicles from Maha Yazawin (1724) onward identify Nawrahta of Kanni as an ancestor (maternal great-great-great grandfather) of King Bayinnaung of Toungoo Dynasty.

Anawrahta was born Min Saw (, ) to King Kunhsaw Kyaunghpyu and Queen Myauk Pyinthe on 11 May 1044. The Burmese chronicles do not agree on the dates regarding his life and reign. The table below lists the dates given by the four main chronicles. Among the chronicles, scholarship usually accepts Zata's dates, which are considered to be the most accurate for the Pagan period.

The Mechanical Man( Italian: L'uomo meccanico) is a 1921 Italian science fiction film directed by André Deed( who also starred in the film as a comedic character named Saltarello). It was produced in 1920, and released in November 1921. It is one of the first science fiction films produced in Italy, and the first film that showed a battle between two robots. The cinematographer was Alberto Chentrens. For many years the original film, which was about 80 minutes in length, was regarded as lost. However, some reels of the Portuguese release version were discovered at the Cinemateca Brasileira in Brazil. The remaining footage amounts to only about 26 minutes( 740 meters). The DVD release by Alpha Video uses the incomplete Brazilian print, with new English intertitles. Film critic Christopher Workman opines that this film had to have influenced Fritz Lang's Metropolis( 1927). Director Deeds began his acting career in France, then moved to Italy where he continued his slapstick style of acting. After finishing The Mechanical Man, he moved back to France where his acting career slightly declined in popularity. He did however direct around 40 films and acted in over 200, before he died in 1940.

Il paese del sesso selvaggio (English: The Country of Savage Sex), also known as Man From Deep River, Deep River Savages and Sacrifice!, is a 1972 Italian cannibal exploitation film directed by Umberto Lenzi and starring Ivan Rassimov, Me Me Lai and Pratitsak Singhara. It is perhaps best known for starting the cannibal boom of Italian exploitation cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Lenzi was probably trying to imitate the content of notorious Mondo cinema, which had gained considerable Grindhouse popularity since Gualtiero Jacopetti and Paolo Cavara made Mondo Cane in 1962, even though this film is fictional. Like Man from Deep River, Mondo films often focus on exotic customs and locations, graphic violence, and animal cruelty. The film was mainly inspired by A Man Called Horse, which also featured a white man who is incorporated into a tribe that originally held him captive. The title Man from Deep River is even supposed to echo the title A Man Called Horse.

Reza Dormishian is an Iranian film director, screenwriter and producer. He has worked as assistant director with notable directors such as Dariush Mehrjui, Fereydoun Jeyrani, and Alireza Davood Nejad. He is one of the most prominent and distinguished directors of the new generation of the Iranian cinema, whose films have been received well by the people, critics, and international festivals because of their social themes and modern structure, but have faced protest from the government and domestic extremist groups. He started writing as a film critic in 1997 for several newspapers. He later worked as an executive editor for cinema books and magazines. He was an assistant to some prestigious Iranian filmmakers, including Dariush Mehrjui and Alireza Davood Nejad. He has also worked as a screenwriter.

Hatred displays the frenzied love and hatred and two accounts from two phases in the life of an Iranian refugee couple in Istanbul, Turkey. The film was received well by critics and cinema writers and the Iranian critics gave it three awards( Best Directing, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing). Although Hatred was censored to be screened in Iran, it was screened and praised in various festivals such as the Competition Section of the 36th Montreal Film Festival in Canada, Competition Section of the 28th Warsaw Film Festival in Poland, and Competition Section of the Camerimage Film Festival in Poland. His second feature, I ’m not angry!, was the most controversial film of the Iranian cinema in 2014. This social drama criticizes the Ahmadinejad era, and it was the only Iranian film present in the Panorama Section of 64th Berlin International Film Festival.  I ’m not angry! was screened in the 32nd Fajr Film Festival while 15 minutes of it had been censored, and it was faced with warm welcome by the audience and grave opposition by extremist groups, to the extent that the cinema authorities stopped its screening. As the hardliners and extremists were going to attack the closing ceremony of the festival with 15 buses of their men, the festival authorities forced Reza Dormishian not to receive his awards and to withdraw his film from the festival, and they announced in the closing ceremony that Reza Dormishian had waived his awards in order to maintain calmness in the Iranian cinema. The jury members, however, revealed the next day that the awards had indeed belonged to I ’m not angry! and that Dormishian had agreed to resignation under pressure. Screening of I ’m not angry! in Iran has been banned since then.

815,"Leo IV the Khazar (Greek:    , Len IV ho Khazaros; 25 January 750 – 8 September 780) was Byzantine Emperor from 775 to 780 AD. He was born to Emperor Constantine V and Empress Tzitzak in 750. He was elevated to caesar the next year, in 751, and married to Irene of Athens in 768. When Constantine V died in September 775, while campaigning against the Bulgarians, Leo IV became senior emperor on 14 September 775. In 778 Leo raided Abbasid Syria, decisively defeating the Abbasid army outside of Germanicia. Leo died on 8 September 780, of tuberculosis. He was meant to be succeeded by his son Constantine VI, but rule instead transferred to his wife Irene, who assumed the role of regent and later empress.

Leo I , also Levon I or Leon I, (unknown – Constantinople, February 14, 1140) was the fifth lord of Armenian Cilicia or “Lord of the Mountains” (1129/1130-1137). He learned to exploit the open, yet restrained, hostilities between the Byzantine Empire and the Crusader principalities of Edessa and Antioch. Most of his successes benefited from Byzantium’s pre-occupation with the threats of Zengi (the atabeg of Mosul) from Aleppo and the lack of effective Frankish rule, especially in the Principality of Antioch. He expanded his rule over the Cilician plains and even to the Mediterranean shores. In his time, relations between the Armenians and the Franks (the Crusaders), two former allies, were not always as courteous as before: a major cause of dissension between them was the ownership of the strongholds of the southern Amanus, and on the neighboring coasts of the Gulf of Alexandretta. Leo was captured after being invited to a meeting by the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus, who had sworn a false promise of peace. Leo and two of his sons were taken captive and imprisoned in Constantinople where Leo died shortly after.

Pope Leo X (11 December 1475 – 1 December 1521), born Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici, was pope and ruler of the Papal States from 9 March 1513 to his death in 1521. Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence, Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of the Florentine Republic, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489. Following the death of Pope Julius II, Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College. Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, but struggled to implement the reforms agreed. In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino, but which reduced papal finances. In Protestant circles, Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter's Basilica, a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther's 95 Theses. He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation, and his Papal Bull of 1520, Exsurge Domine, condemned Martin Luther's condemnatory stance, rendering ongoing communication difficult. He borrowed and spent money without circumspection. A significant patron of the arts, upon election Leo is alleged to have said, Since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it.  Under his reign, progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms.

825,"Cecilia of Normandy (or Cecily; c. 1056 – 30 July 1126) is thought to be the eldest daughter of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. Her brothers were kings William II and Henry I of England. She was very close to her other brother, Robert Curthose, and was educated by the abbess Matilda. Cecilia was entered into the Abbey of Caen at a young age by her parents. She became Abbess of Holy Trinity in 1112. Cecilia died on 30 July 1126 in Caen, France. She was buried within the abbey walls. Her tomb is walled up without any opening being left through which it can be discovered. Her father was also buried in Caen.

Countess Marie Karoline von Fuchs-Mollard (14 January 1681 – 27 April 1754), known as Charlotte, was the governess of Maria Theresa of Austria. Born in Vienna, Marie Karoline came to the imperial court as lady-in-waiting of the future queen consort of Portugal, Maria Anna of Austria, the daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1710, she married Count Christoph Ernst von Fuchs, with whom she had two daughters. Empress Elisabeth Christine entrusted the Countess with the education and upbringing of her daughter Maria Theresa, the heiress presumptive of the Habsburg dominions, when the girl was born in 1717. Countess Fuchs taught her etiquette and practically raised her. Maria Theresa developed a notably close relationship with Countess Fuchs. When Maria Theresa succeeded her father as the ruler of Hungary, Bohemia and Austria, she gave Countess Fuchs a castle (Fuchsschlössl) and made her a chatelaine. When Countess Fuchs died in Vienna, Maria Theresa ordered that she be buried in the Imperial Crypt. Thus, the Countess has the honour of being the only non-Habsburg buried in the Imperial Crypt. The 150th anniversary of her death was celebrated by a special Mass in the Capucin Crypt.

Caecilia Metella was daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer and Clodia Pulchra. She was an infamous woman in Rome during the late Republic and a celebrity of sorts.

Cecilia Maria de Candia (24 December 1853, Brighton, England – 26 May 1926, Bordighera, Italy), later Mrs Godfrey Pearse, was a British-Italian writer, amateur singer and society hostess.

Who is Adolf, Duke Of Bavaria's maternal grandfather?",leopold i holy roman emperor,adolph i,0.6257831454277039,0.0,False
826,"Adolf (7 January 1434, Munich - 24 October 1441, Munich) was a German nobleman. He was a Duke of Bavaria-Munich in the House of Wittelsbach. He was the eldest son of William III, Duke of Bavaria and Margaret of Cleves. His younger brother William of Bavaria-Munich died in infancy. Since William III's brother Ernest and Ernest's son Albert III were available as ruling dukes, Adolf's role was very limited. He died aged only seven and thus had little effect on the duchy's fortunes.

Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria (Albrecht Luitpold Ferdinand Michael; 3 May 1905 – 8 July 1996) was the son of the last crown prince of Bavaria, Rupprecht, and his first wife, Duchess Marie Gabrielle in Bavaria. He was the only child from that marriage that reached adulthood. His paternal grandfather was Ludwig III of Bavaria, the last king of Bavaria, who was deposed in 1918.

Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, also known as Johann Nepomuk Hüttler (19 March 1807 – 17 September 1888), was a maternal great-grandfather and possibly also the paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler. Johann Nepomuk was named after the Bohemian Saint Johann von Nepomuk. Some view this name as evidence that Nepomuk and subsequently his great-grandson Adolf Hitler had Czech ancestry. However, Johann von Pomuk/Johann Nepomuk, was an important saint for Bohemians of both German and Czech ethnicity. Nepomuk thus only indicates ties to Bohemia and central Europe. Nepomuk became a relatively prosperous farmer and was married to Eva Maria Decker (1792–1873) who was fifteen years his senior. On 19 January 1830, Eva Hiedler gave birth to Johanna. Legally, he was the step-uncle of Alois Schicklgruber (later Alois Hitler), the stepson of his brother Johann Georg Hiedler, a wandering miller. For reasons unknown, Johann Nepomuk took in Alois when he was a boy and raised him. It is possible that he was, in fact, Alois' natural father but could not acknowledge this publicly due to his marriage. Another, and perhaps simpler, explanation for this kindness is that Nepomuk took pity on the ten-year-old Alois and took him in. Alois was, after all, the stepson of his brother Johann Georg, and Nepomuk may have known that in fact Alois was Johann Georg's natural child. After the death of Alois' mother Maria, it could hardly have been a suitable life for a ten-year old child to be raised by an itinerant miller. Nepomuk left Alois a considerable portion of his life savings. Nepomuk's granddaughter, Klara, had a longstanding affair with Alois before marrying him in 1885 after the death of his second wife. In 1889 she gave birth to Adolf Hitler.

Ludwig I (9 February 1763 – 30 March 1830) succeeded as Grand Duke of Baden on 8 December 1818. He was the uncle of his predecessor Karl Ludwig Friedrich, and his death marked the end of the Zähringen line of the House of Baden. He was succeeded by his half brother, Leopold. He secured the continued existence of the University of Freiburg in 1820, after which the University was called the Albert-Ludwig University. He also founded the Polytechnic Hochschule Karlsruhe in 1825. The Hochschule is the oldest technical school in Germany. Ludwig's death in 1830 led to many rumors. His death also meant the extinction of his line of the Baden family. The succession then went to the children of the morganatic second marriage of Grand Duke Karl Friedrich and Louise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg, who was created Countess of Hochberg in the Austrian nobility at the personal request of Karl Friedrich. After Ludwig's death, there was much discussion about a mysterious seventeen-year-old man named Kaspar Hauser, who had appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 1828. Seventeen years previously, the first son of the future Grand Duke Karl and his French wife Stéphanie de Beauharnais died under what were later portrayed as mysterious circumstances. There was at the time and still is today (in 2007) speculation that Hauser, who died (perhaps murdered) in 1833, was that child. Working together with architect Friedrich Weinbrenner, Louis is responsible for most of the classical revival buildings in the city center and for building the pyramid.

Maximilian, Margrave of Baden, Duke of Zähringen (Maximilian Andreas Friedrich Gustav Ernst August Bernhard; born 3 July 1933), is the elder son of Berthold, Margrave of Baden and Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark.

He is the head of the Grand-Ducal House of Baden and the representative of the descent of the Kings of Sweden of the House of Holstein-Gottorp.

Elizabeth de Burgh (c. 1284 – 27 October 1327) was the second wife and the only queen consort of King Robert the Bruce. Elizabeth was born sometime around 1284, probably in Down or Antrim in Ireland. She was the daughter of one of the most powerful Irish nobles of the period, Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, who was a close friend and ally of Edward I of England. Not much is known about Elizabeth, despite her husband's status as one of the most famous Scottish kings and warriors. As is the case with most medieval women, records of Elizabeth are scarce; however, it is clear that she was caught up in the political turmoil that unfolded between the Scottish and the English during the reign of her husband King Robert, had to move several times to keep safe, and was eventually seized as a prisoner.

Renegades, known as American Renegades in the United States, is a 2017 action thriller film directed by Steven Quale and written by Luc Besson and Richard Wenk. The film stars Sullivan Stapleton, J.

Renegades were a British rock band which started out as a side- project from two members of the band Feeder, featuring guitarist Grant Nicholas and bassist Taka Hirose, before becoming a pseudonym name for Feeder themselves. Nicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother, who completed the group and a four- track EP was then recorded. Soon later, Renegades became an alternative name for Feeder at various concerts where they would play an entire show pretending not to be Feeder, but a different band with the same members. If Feeder songs released before the Renegades album were to be played, the band would announce that they're covering Feeder songs. Grant Nicholas once introduced Tangerine as A cover of a song from a band we know. The idea was created when Feeder parted company with drummer Mark Richardson who returned to his previous band Skunk Anansie. Brazil was initially contracted with the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university events, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was however recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before the idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the' Renegades' project. The tracks originally intended for the side- project were soon used for the seventh Feeder album Renegades. The side- project was as a result used as a method to promote the Renegades album at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder. On the first of January 2010, a four- day countdown timer was added to the band's official website. As the countdown was completed on 6 January 2010, the title- track for the EP, Renegades was released as a free download as well as a package containing the limited edition EP, Renegades shirt, badge set and an e-ticket for one of the six shows available. The Renegades EP was the first release on the band's own record label, before being followed- up by a second EP. Feeder also used the Renegades name for their Sonisphere 2010 appearance, which was their last UK show using this name and also their tour of Japan in July of the same year. The track Renegades was re-released, but this time as a Feeder single instead of Renegades and was also on vinyl and download only.

A Midsummer Night's Rave is a film adapted from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream released in 2002. The film stars Corey Pearson, Lauren German, Andrew Keegan, Chad Lindberg, and Sunny Mabrey; and was directed by Gil Cates Jr. It is set at a rave, rather than the forest where most of the original is set. The film received little attention from professional movie critics, but is considered a success with teen audiences, and has been used as an exemplar for a category of movies (the McShakespeare, an example of McDonaldization) in more academic publications.

Pornography: A Thriller is a 2009 American mystery/thriller film, written and directed by David Kittredge. Pornography: A Thriller is a non-linear story in three parts, all revolving around the disappearance of fictional adult gay film actor Mark Anton (Jared Grey). The first act depicts Anton's final days in 1995, the second is about writer Michael Castigan (Matthew Montgomery) as he searches for the truth in 2009 about what happened to Anton, and the third revolves around 2009 adult film actor Matt Stevens's (Pete Scherer) attempt to make The Mark Anton Story, based in part on his dreams of what happened to Anton. The film uses an unconventional structure, with actors playing multiple roles in different sections, and uses dream logic to tell its story through a subjective point of view. Because of this, it has been compared to the work of David Lynch (most notably Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive) and David Cronenberg (notably Videodrome). Kittredge says about the structure, We wanted to replicate the dream logic of a nightmare. So even though we don’t spell everything out for the audience, the film is still a complete whole and has its own fully formed arc that’s hopefully a satisfying whole.

Do n't Go Near the Park is a 1979 American supernatural horror film directed by Lawrence D. Foldes, and starring Aldo Ray, Meeno Peluce, Tamara Taylor, Robert Gribbin, Barbara Bain, and Linnea Quigley. Its plot follows a brother and sister, both cursed in prehistoric times, who remain on earth and must subsist on the entrails of young people; in an attempt to break their curse and achieve immortality, the brother conceives a child as a virginal sacrifice.

The film was released theatrically in September 1981. It gained notoriety when it was successfully prosecuted for obscenity in the United Kingdom and placed on the video nasty list due to its violent content. In the intervening years, it was released on the home video market under several alternate titles, such as Night Stalker and Curse of the Living Dead. Critical response to the film was largely negative, and it attracted commentary in subsequent decades for its themes of cannibalism, incest, and pedophilia. In 2006, Dark Sky Films released a DVD edition featuring the original U.S. theatrical cut.

836,"Edward Ellsworth Annis (born February 2, 1980) is a Canadian professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Teddy Hart. He currently wrestles on the independent circuit. He most recently wrestled on a National scale for Major League Wrestling (MLW) as the leader of The Hart Foundation, where he was the longest reigning MLW World Middleweight Champion and also held the MLW World Tag Team Championship. He has also wrestled for AAA, the short-lived Wrestling Society X, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, and Dragon Gate USA. He operates a wrestling school in Edmonton. He is the son of Georgia Hart of the Hart family and wrestler B.J. Annis. Hart achieved an early degree of fame when he became the youngest wrestler to be signed to the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE). His subsequent release and controversial actions while wrestling on the independent circuit have earned him a measure of infamy. Outside of the ring Annis has been a mentor to several young wrestlers and has been a trainer at wrestling schools. Among his trainees are Jack Evans, Pete Wilson and his younger cousin Matt Hart. Annis is also a cat lover and breeder of Persian cats which he has used sometimes in storylines and brought with him to matches.

Stewart Edward Hart, (May 3, 1915 – October 16, 2003) was a Canadian professional wrestler, wrestling booker, promoter, coach and trainer, football player, amateur wrestler, and sailor. He is best known for founding and handling Stampede Wrestling, a professional wrestling promotion based in Calgary, Alberta, teaching many individuals at its associated wrestling school The Dungeon and establishing a professional wrestling dynasty consisting of his relatives and close trainees. As the patriarch of the Hart wrestling family, Hart is the ancestor of many wrestlers, most notably being the father of Bret and Owen Hart as well as the grandfather of Natalya Neidhart, Teddy Hart and David Hart Smith. Hart was born to a poor Saskatchewan family but became a successful amateur wrestler during the 1930s and early 1940s, holding many national championships, as well as engaging in many other sports. He began wrestling for show in 1943 with the Royal Canadian Navy while serving in World War II as he could not go to the 1940 Summer Olympics due to the war. After leaving the service he travelled to America and debuted professionally for the New York wrestling territory in 1946. Hart was considered very handsome and a good in-ring performer, focusing on a submission-like and technical style of wrestling, but despite this and being popular in general he was not given a major spotlight by the writers, and soon after marrying Helen Smith, whom he met in New York City, he created his own promotion in Edmonton, Alberta which would be known as Stampede Wrestling and took over the surrounding wrestling territory which covered most of western Canada and the US state of Montana. The territory would go on to become known as the Stampede territory thenceforth. In 1949, Stu and Helen moved to Great Falls, Montana. Hart's promotion featured a large variety of outside stars from the wrestling industry as well as homegrown talent for whom he booked storylines. Beginning from the 1950s Hart helped train a large number of people for his company and gained a reputation as one of the best teachers in the wrestling business. In October 1951, Stu and Helen moved to Calgary, Alberta, into what would become the famous Hart House. Hart remained an active full-time wrestler until the 1960s when he entered semi-in-ring retirement, thereafter he would focus mostly on promoting, booking and teaching, as well as raising his twelve children with Helen while still appearing in the ring sporadically until the 1980s. Throughout his career, Hart almost exclusively portrayed a heroic character, a so-called babyface role and only held one professional title, the NWA Northwest Tag Team Championship. After selling his territory to Titan Sports, Inc. in 1984, Hart would make several appearances on WWF television and Pay-Per-View with his wife, often involved in storylines surrounding his sons Bret and Owen and several of his sons-in-law who were signed to the company. He continued to teach wrestling at his home in Calgary until the 1990s when he suffered a severe leg injury and had to stop engaging excessively with students, leaving most of the work for his sons Bruce and Keith. He died at age 88 in October 2003 after suffering from multiple medical issues. Hart is regarded by many, including major wrestling historian and sports journalist Dave Meltzer, as one of the most influential and important figures in professional wrestling history and an icon of the artform. His greatest contribution to the art was as a promoter and trainer. Along with Bret and Owen, Hart's trainees included future world champions Fritz Von Erich, Superstar Billy Graham, Chris Jericho, Edge, Christian, Mark Henry, Chris Benoit, and Jushin Thunder Liger. Hart was a member of the inaugural Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame class in 1996 and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2010 by his son Bret. Hart was also well known for his involvement in over thirty charities, for which he was named a Member of the Order of Canada, the second highest honour for merit which can be given in Canada and the highest civilian honour.

839,"St George William Lane Fox-Pitt (born 14 September 1856 in Malta, died 6 April 1932 in South Eaton Place) was a British electrical engineer and student of psychic phenomena. His parents were Lieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane-Fox (1827–1900) and Alice Margaret (1828–1910, née Stanley). On the death of his father's cousin Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers, the family took the name Fox Pitt-Rivers on May 25, 1880. In 1878, Fox-Pitt was granted a patent on a light bulb with a platinum-iridium filament. The patent also describes a system for power distribution using incandescent lamps in parallel. On 12 December 1879, Charles Francis Brush founded the Anglo-American Electric Light Company Ltd in the UK, and in the same year acquired the patent rights to produce the Lane-Fox incandescent lamp. On 24 March 1880, he founded a new company, Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation, which took over the previous one. About 1880, Fox-Pitt is said to have successfully experimented with charred plant fibres as the filament material. That was about the same time as the development of the light bulb with carbon filament by Edison in the United States. By 1883, Fox-Pitt had obtained further patents. Fox-Pitt wrote books on the philosophy of science, education, and social problems. He was temporarily Vice-President of the Moral Education League and organized the International Moral Education Congress. He was also one of the first active members of the Society for Psychical Research. In 1891, he repurchased the patent rights of the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation and built himself a small lamp factory. In 1898, he participated in a railway concession in Ecuador. In 1899, he married Lady Edith Gertrude Douglas (1874–1963), the daughter of John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry.

In 1870, Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to study the Bible. During the course of his ministry, Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul, hellfire, predestination, the fleshly return of Jesus Christ, the Trinity, and the burning up of the world. In 1876, Russell met Nelson H. Barbour; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds, which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy. The book taught that God's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally, each ending with a harvest, that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the harvest of the Gospel age, and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called the Gentile Times, at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God's kingdom on earth. Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal, Herald of the Morning. In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences, and in July, Russell began publishing the magazine Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence, stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in the last days, and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent.

In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London, Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend. Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward Ted, was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from tuberculosis. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as A.G. Bell) and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, Bath, England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at University College London, Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.

Wong Kar- wai( born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best- of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama As Tears Go By( 1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles.  Days of Being Wild( 1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time( 1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time- consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express( 1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046( 2004) and The Grandmaster( 2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

854,"Ibrahim Shah Suri was the fifth ruler of Sur dynasty, a Pashtun( Afghan) dynasty of late medieval northern India.

Sikandar Shah Suri (died 1559) was the sixth ruler of Sur dynasty, a late medieval Pashtun dynasty of northern India. He became the sultan of Delhi after overthrowing Ibrahim Shah Suri.

Islam Shah Suri (reigned: 1545–1554) was the second ruler of the Suri dynasty which ruled part of India in the mid-16th century. His original name was Jalal Khan and he was the second son of Sher Shah Suri.

Sher Shah Suri (1486 – 22 May 1545), born Fard Khn, was the founder of the Suri Empire in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, with its capital in Sasaram in modern-day Bihar. He introduced the currency of rupee. An ethnic Pashtun, Sher Shah took control of the Mughal Empire in 1538. After his accidental death in 1545, his son Islam Shah became his successor. He first served as a private before rising to become a commander in the Mughal army under Babur and then the governor of Bihar. In 1537, when Babur's son Humayun was elsewhere on an expedition, Sher Shah overran the state of Bengal and established the Suri dynasty. A brilliant strategist, Sher Shah proved himself as a gifted administrator as well as a capable general. His reorganization of the empire laid the foundations for the later Mughal emperors, notably Akbar, son of Humayun. During his seven-year rule from 1538 to 1545, he set up a new economic and military administration, issued the first Rupiya from Taka and organized the postal system of the Indian Subcontinent. Some of his strategies and contributions were later ideolized by the Mughal emperors, most notably Akbar. Suri further developed Humayun's Dina-panah city and named it Shergarh and revived the historical city of Pataliputra, which had been in decline since the 7th century CE, as Patna. He extended the Grand Trunk Road from Chittagong in the frontiers of the province of Bengal in northeast India to Kabul in Afghanistan in the far northwest of the country. The influence of his innovations and reforms extended far beyond his brief reign; his arch foe, Humayun, referred to him as “Ustad-I-Badshahan”, teacher of kings.

The tomb of Sher Shah Suri is in the Sasaram town of Bihar state, India. The tomb was built in memory of Emperor Sher Shah Suri, a Pathan from Bihar who defeated the Mughal Empire and founded the Suri Empire in northern India. He died in an accidental gunpowder explosion in the fort of Kalinjar on 10th day of Rabi' al-awwal, A.H. 952 or 13 May 1545 AD.

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a computing machine and one of the first computer programmers. Lovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart? . He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace. Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as poetical science and herself as an Analyst (& Metaphysician). When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as the father of computers. She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of poetical science led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool. She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.

On November 23, 1921, The Belmont Citizen, a newspaper in Belmont, Massachusetts, reviewed the movie in their column On Stage and Screen when it played at The Belmont-Waverley Strand Theater on Trapelo Road (now known as The Studio Cinema). Under the headline Alice Joyce to be seen in 'The Inner Chamber,' it read:Alice Joyce, the star of 'The Inner Chamber,' is kind-hearted and always ready to lend a helping hand. In one of the early scenes of the production, which will be shown at the Belmont-Waverley Strand theater on Monday and Tuesday, November 28 and 29, she poses as a stenographer, and from her scanty earnings buys her mother some fruit. Before the scene is made, the star stopped at a nearby fruit store and purchased some pears.

On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called daughter of his body. On a relief found at Saqqara she is called his beloved daughter and king's daughter.

At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win the Palme d' Or at the Cannes Film Festival which garnered the film worldwide commercial success, among numerous accolades. His breakthrough saw him to Hollywood where he directed crime comedy Out of Sight( 1998); biopic Erin Brockovich( 2000) and crime drama film Traffic( 2000), the latter winning him the Academy Award for Best Director.

Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts often used for big budget Hollywood movies but with an avant garde arthouse approach to them.

Philip Kaufman (born October 23, 1936) is an American film director and screenwriter who has directed fifteen films over a career spanning more than six decades. He has been described as a maverick and an iconoclast, notable for his versatility and independence. He is considered an auteur, whose films have always expressed his personal vision. Kaufman's works have included genres such as realism, horror, fantasy, erotica, Westerns, underworld crime, and inner city gangs. His choice of topics has been eclectic and sometimes controversial, having adapted novels with diverse themes and stories. Examples are Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), Michael Crichton's Rising Sun (1993), a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), and the erotic writings of Anaïs Nin's Henry & June. His film The Wanderers (1979) has achieved cult status. But his greatest success was Tom Wolfe's true-life The Right Stuff, which received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. According to film historian Annette Insdorf, no other living American director has so consistently and successfully made movies for adults, tackling sensuality, artistic creation, and manipulation by authorities. Other critics note that Kaufman's films are strong on mood and atmosphere, with powerful cinematography and a lyrical, poetic style to portray different historic periods. His later films have a somewhat European style, but the stories always stress individualism and integrity, and are clearly American.

Frankie Laine (born Francesco Paolo LoVecchio; March 30, 1913 – February 6, 2007) was an American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spanned nearly 75 years, from his first concerts in 1930 with a marathon dance company to his final performance of That's My Desire in 2005. Often billed as America's Number One Song Stylist, his other nicknames include Mr. RhythmOld Leather Lungs, and Mr. Steel Tonsils. His hits included That's My DesireThat Lucky Old SunMule TrainJezebelHigh NoonI BelieveHey Joe!The Kid's Last FightCool WaterRawhide, and Lord, You Gave Me a Mountain. He sang well-known theme songs for many movie Western soundtracks, including , Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Blazing Saddles, although his recordings were not charted as a country & western. Laine sang an eclectic variety of song styles and genres, stretching from big band crooning to pop, western-themed songs, gospel, rock, folk, jazz, and blues. He did not sing the soundtrack song for High Noon, which was sung by Tex Ritter, but his own version (with somewhat altered lyrics, omitting the name of the antagonist, Frank Miller) was the one that became a bigger hit, nor did he sing the theme to another show he is commonly associated with—Champion the Wonder Horse (sung by Mike Stewart)—but released his own, subsequently more popular, version. Laine's enduring popularity was illustrated in June 2011, when a TV-advertised compilation called Hits reached No. 16 on the British chart. The accomplishment was achieved nearly 60 years after his debut on the UK chart, 64 years after his first major U.S. hit and four years after his death.

Compañeros (Spanish: Vamos a matar, compañeros, lit. Let's Go and Kill, Companions) is a 1970 Zapata Western film directed by Sergio Corbucci. The film stars Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, Jack Palance and Fernando Rey. The soundtrack for the film was written by Ennio Morricone, and the orchestra was conducted by Bruno Nicolai. Compañeros is one of Corbucci's best-known westerns, as well as one of the best-known spaghetti westerns altogether. The film has been compared to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, as it intertwines the paths of several characters in the middle of a conflict, but takes place during the Mexican Revolution instead of the American Civil War.

Alejandro Ulloa was the cinematographer for both films. Compañeros is the only film in which the two stars of Italian genre films, Franco Nero and Tomás Milián, acted together.

When was Britannicus's father born?",1738,1 august 10,0.18904340267181396,0.0,False
907,"Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus( c. 12 February AD 41 – 11 February AD 55), usually called Britannicus, was the son of Roman emperor Claudius and his third wife Valeria Messalina. For a time he was considered his father's heir, but that changed after his mother's downfall in 48, when it was revealed she had engaged in a bigamous marriage without Claudius' knowledge. The next year, his father married Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' fourth and final marriage. Their marriage was followed by the adoption of Agrippina's son, Lucius Domitius, whose name became Nero as a result. His step- brother would later be married to his sister Octavia, and soon eclipsed him as Claudius' heir. Following his father's death in October 54, Nero became emperor. The sudden death of Britannicus shortly before his fourteenth birthday is reported by all extant sources as a poisoning on Nero's orders—as Claudius' natural son, he represented a threat to Nero's claim to the throne.

Germanicus (Latin: Germanicus Julius Caesar; 24 May 15 BC – 10 October AD 19) was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and a prominent general of the Roman Empire, who was known for his campaigns in Germania. The son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, Germanicus was born into an influential branch of the patrician gens Claudia. The agnomen Germanicus was added to his full name in 9 BC when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honor of his victories in Germania. In AD 4, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, Tiberius, who succeeded Augustus as Roman emperor a decade later. As a result, Germanicus became an official member of the gens Julia, another prominent family which he was related to on his mother's side. His connection to the Julii was further consolidated through a marriage between himself and Agrippina the Elder, a granddaughter of Augustus. He was also the nephew of Tiberius, the older brother of Claudius, the father of Caligula, and the maternal grandfather of Nero. During the reign of Augustus, Germanicus enjoyed an accelerated political career as the heir of the emperor's heir, entering the office of quaestor five years before the legal age in AD 7. He held that office until AD 11, and was elected consul for the first time in AD 12. The year after, he was made proconsul of Germania Inferior, Germania Superior, and all of Gaul. From there he commanded eight legions, about one-third of the entire Roman army, which he led against the Germanic tribes in his campaigns from AD 14 to 16. He avenged the Roman Empire's defeat in the Teutoburg Forest and retrieved two of the three legionary eagles that had been lost during the battle. In AD 17 he returned to Rome where he received a triumph before leaving to reorganize the provinces of Asia Minor, whereby he incorporated the provinces of Cappadocia and Commagene in AD 18. While in the eastern provinces, he came into conflict with the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. During their feud, Germanicus became ill in Antioch, where he died on 10 October AD 19. His death has been attributed to poison by ancient sources, but that was never proven. As a famous general, he was widely popular and regarded as the ideal Roman long after his death. To the Roman people, Germanicus was the Roman equivalent of Alexander the Great due to the nature of his death at a young age, his virtuous character, his dashing physique, and his military renown.

Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus (? – died around 32 B.C.) was a Roman statesman. Lucius Bibulus was the son of Julius Caesar's implacable enemy Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus and possibly, Porcia Catonis (daughter of Cato the Younger), although it is unlikely. His two elder brothers were killed in Egypt by some of the soldiery which Aulus Gabinius had left there after having restored Ptolemy Auletes to the throne. His father died in 48 BC from the exhaustion and strain of commanding the republican fleets against Caesar. After Caesar's murder, Lucius chose the side of Marcus Junius Brutus, Porcia's new husband, for whom he fought at the battle of Philippi. After the defeat of Caesar's murderers, he surrendered to Marcus Antonius who later gave him command of his fleet. Bibulus was later made governor of Syria by Augustus and he died around 32 BC.

Pomponia Caecilia Attica or Caecilia Pomponia Attica (born 51 BC) was the daughter of Cicero's Epicurean friend and eques, knight, Titus Pomponius Atticus.

Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus( born 161 -?) was a Roman noble of Greek Athenian and Italian Roman descent who lived in the Roman Empire. Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus was the son born to the Aristocrat Lucius Vibullius Rufus and the noblewoman Athenais. He had an elder paternal half brother called Lucius Vibullius Claudius Herodes. The parents of Hipparchus were paternal second cousins. The paternal grandfather of Hipparchus was Publius Aelius Vibullius Rufus who served as an Archon of Athens in 143- 144 AD, while his maternal grandparents were Roman Senator, Sophist Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes or Herodes Atticus and the Roman aristocratic noblewoman Aspasia Annia Regilla. His grandfathers were first cousins as the mother of Herodes Atticus and the father of Publius Aelius Vibullius Rufus were brother and sister. Through his late maternal grandmother, Hipparchus was a relative to the family of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius and the Roman Empress Faustina the Elder. When Hipparchus was born, Athenais named him in honor of his maternal grandfather and paternal great grandfather. Shortly after his birth Athenais had died. Hipparchus was raised by his father, even perhaps by his maternal grandfather. He was born and raised in Athens. According to surviving inscriptions, Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus is the only recorded grandchild of Herodes Atticus and Aspasia Annia Regilla. Apart from Hipparchus, there is a possibility that Herodes Atticus and Aspasia Annia Regilla could have other grandchildren from their other children ’s marriages. Not much is known on the life of Hipparchus. He married an unnamed noble woman by whom he had a daughter called Athenais.

William de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Warwick (before 1140 – 15 November 1184) was an English nobleman. He was married to Matilda de Percy (†c. 1204), daughter of William de Percy (†1175) and his first wife Alice of Tonbridge (†1148). He inherited the earldom from Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick. On his father's death in 1153, William may have been a minor. William died, probably on Crusade, in 1184, and was succeeded by his brother Waleran de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Warwick.

He was also known as Walerian de Newburg. After the death of his brother, William de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Warwick, an impostor arose, claiming to be the deceased Earl; he gave Waleran a great deal of trouble in maintaining his claim. He does not appear to have been a great soldier, for he paid scutage money to escape military service in Wales. His position in the Court is attested by his bearing the right hand Sword of State at the Coronation of John, King of England, 27 May 1199. He liberally supported the hospital of St Michael's Hospital, Warwick and gave to the nuns of Pinley land at Claverdon, and land at Brailes to the nuns at Wroxall, Warwickshire.

He was also known as Thomas de Henry. Although he had attained his majority at the death of his father, he did not get full possession of the earldom until four years later, when he was girt with the Sword of Knighthood; this took place at Gloucester where the King was spending Whitsuntide. He inherited his uncle's( Henry D' Oili) Oxfordshire estate and owned the Manor of Bewdley, Worcester and rendered service for it, of a fully equipped archer for twenty days, as often as there was war against the Welsh. In 1241, he paid one hundred and eighty marks scutage in order that he might be excused attendance on Henry III of England in the expedition to Gascony. This was in excess of the sum due from him; the following year he paid a further one hundred and twenty marks. At the coronation of Eleanor of Provence, the Queen Consort of Henry III, on 26 June, 1236 he bore the third Sword of State, claiming that it was his hereditary right to do so. He married Ela Longespee, daughter of William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, natural son to Henry II. Amongst Ela's benefactions were grants to the monks at Reading, Berkshire, the Canons of Osney, Oxfordshire, St Sepulchre's, Warwick, the grey friars in London, and the Nuns of Godstow, Oxford.

He is known for his collaboration with Tage Danielsson as the duo Hasse & Tage and their production company AB Svenska Ord (Swedish Words Ltd). His most celebrated contribution to their brand of humorist humanism was his ability to extemporize wildly absurd comic situations, for example in the Lindeman dialogues. Already in 1970 he gave a taste of another and less comedic side in the role as an rather unpleasant civil servant in Grisjakten. As time went by, Alfredson more or less totally turned around to become a serious author and film director. In 1982 he both directed and participated in the film The Simple-Minded Murderer, a motion picture based on his own novel En ond manAn evil man). Here Alfredson portrayed a rich and indeed very unpleasant manufacturer and Nazi-supporter who tormented the inhabitants of his native Scanian country-side in the 1930's.

In the mid-zeroes he participated in the Danish criminal-odyssey The Eagle, and his last cinematic work came with the 2009 The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. A film directed by one of his two sons, Daniel Alfredson. Alfredson played a hitman. Towards the end of his life, Alfredson made it clear that he strongly preferred his real name – Hans – not the rather commonly nickname Hasse.

919,"Sancha of Castile (–1179) was daughter of Alfonso VII of León and Castile and his first wife Berengaria of Barcelona. Sancha was the fifth child of seven born to her parents. On 20 July 1153, Sancha married Sancho VI of Navarre. He is responsible for bringing his kingdom into the political orbit of Europe. As la reyna de Navarra, filla del emperador (the queen of Navarre, daughter of the Emperor) her August 1179 death was reported in the Annales Toledanos.

Sancha of León (born 1191 or 1192) was the eldest child and daughter of Alfonso IX of León by his first wife, Theresa of Portugal. She was raised at the court of their father, but her younger sister Dulce and her brother Ferdinand were raised with their mother in Portugal after the annulment of their parents' marriage in 1195. Although in Castile it was customary for females to inherit, and Sancha's stepmother became queen, briefly, of Castile, in León female succession was barred, although her ancestor Urraca had been the first queen regnant of Western Europe. After the death of Sancha's brother (1214), Alfonso IX named his second son, also Ferdinand, his heir, bestowing on him the title infante (1216). In 1217, with the support of the aristocracy, Alfonso granted his daughters Sancha and Dulce the villages of Portela de San Juan, Burgo de Ribadavia and Allariz, to be ruled by them until their deaths, after which they would revert to the Crown. In that same year, Ferdinand's mother, Berengaria, inherited the Kingdom of Castile, but ceded it to her son, who was proclaimed king at Valladolid on 2 July. With his heir out of the kingdom and ruling in another place, Alfonso attempted to make his eldest daughters his joint heirs. In the Treaty of Boronal concluded with Portugal in 1219, Alfonso expressly states that if he should die, Portugal should respect the agreement with his daughters. Alfonso also attempted to secure his eldest daughter's rights by marrying her to John of Brienne, the former King of Jerusalem, but his wife Berengaria blocked this action in order to advance her son. In the spring of 1224, John was on the Way of Saint James, passing through Alfonso's kingdom, when he decided to stop in Toledo in order to see his prospective bride. There the queen convinced him instead to marry her daughter, Berengaria, and on his return trip, at Burgos, he did, his wife and he being accompanied as far as Logroño by the king and former queen of Castile. After this fiasco, Alfonso declared Sancha and Dulce his heirs, but upon his death on 24 September 1230, the people of León, who had pledged for Ferdinand in 1206, refused to recognise his daughters, and they in turn ceded their rights to his kingdom to their half-brother. She was 38 years old at the time. This agreement, negotiated at Valencia de Don Juan by Berengaria and Theresa, with Sancha and Dulce present, is known as the pact of the mothers. The treaty was signed Benavente and in compensation Ferdinand promised a yearly stipend of 30,000 maravedíes to each of his half-sisters and the lordship of certain castles.

Sancha of Aragon (1186–1241) was the daughter of King Alfonso II of Aragon and his wife, Sancha of Castile. Through her marriage to Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse in 1211, she acquired the titles Countess of Toulouse and Marquise of Provence from then until their divorce in 1241. Sancha's paternal grandparents were Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona and Petronilla of Aragon; her maternal grandparents were Alfonso VII of León and Castile and Richeza of Poland, Queen of Castile. She was the sister of Peter II of Aragon and Alfonso II, Count of Provence. She had one child, Joan, Countess of Toulouse, who held the same titles as her mother from 1249 to 1271.

Sancha of Castile (21 September 1154/5 – 9 November 1208) was the only surviving child of King Alfonso VII of Castile by his second wife, Richeza of Poland. On January 18, 1174, she married King Alfonso II of Aragon at Zaragoza; they had at least eight children who survived into adulthood. A patroness of troubadours such as Giraud de Calanson and Peire Raymond, the queen became involved in a legal dispute with her husband concerning properties which formed part of her dower estates. In 1177 she entered the county of Ribagorza and took forcible possession of various castles and fortresses which had belonged to the crown there. After her husband died at Perpignan in 1196, Sancha was relegated to the background of political affairs by her son Peter II. She retired from court, withdrawing to the Hospitaller convent for noble ladies, the Monastery of Santa María de Sigena, at Sigena, which she had founded. There she assumed the cross of the Order of St John of Jerusalem which she wore until the end of her life. The queen mother entertained her widowed daughter Constance at Sigena prior to her leaving Aragon to marry Emperor Frederick II in 1208. She died soon afterwards, aged fifty-four, and was interred in front of the high altar of her foundation at the Monastery of Santa María de Sigena; her tomb is still there to be seen.

Berengaria of Navarre (1165–1170 – 23 December 1230) was queen of England as the wife of Richard I of England. She was the eldest daughter of Sancho VI of Navarre and Sancha of Castile. As is the case with many of the medieval English queens, relatively little is known of her life. Traditionally known as the only English queen never to set foot in the country, she may in fact have visited the country after her husband's death, but did not do so before, nor did she see much of him during her marriage, which was childless. She did (unusually for the wife of a Crusader) accompany him on the start of the Third Crusade, but mostly lived in his French possessions, where she gave generously to the church, despite difficulties in collecting the pension she was due from Richard's brother and successor John after she became a widow.

After selling his properties to his son's wife's family, he lived out his final years alone on the St. Leonards property in relatively poor circumstances. He is buried at All Saints Church in Upper Swan.

Wong Kar- wai( born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best- of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama As Tears Go By( 1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles.  Days of Being Wild( 1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time( 1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time- consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express( 1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046( 2004) and The Grandmaster( 2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

He worked on research and engineering of radio and defense electronics in general. Later, Fubini became Assistant Secretary of Defense (1963) and a major voice for the policy of technological supremacy during the Cold War. He also served as the chairman of the U.S. Communications Security board. Dr. Fubini was the son of Mathematician Guido Fubini. The Defense Science Board presents the Eugene G.

Guido Fubini (19 January 1879 – 6 June 1943) was an Italian mathematician, known for Fubini's theorem and the Fubini–Study metric. Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied differential geometry under Ulisse Dini and Luigi Bianchi. His 1900 doctoral thesis was about Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces. After earning his doctorate, he took up a series of professorships. In 1901 he began teaching at the University of Catania in Sicily; shortly afterwards he moved to the University of Genoa; and in 1908 he moved to the Politecnico in Turin and then the University of Turin, where he would stay for a few decades. During this time his research focused primarily on topics in mathematical analysis, especially differential equations, functional analysis, and complex analysis; but he also studied the calculus of variations, group theory, non-Euclidean geometry, and projective geometry, among other topics. With the outbreak of World War I, he shifted his work towards more applied topics, studying the accuracy of artillery fire; after the war, he continued in an applied direction, applying results from this work to problems in electrical circuits and acoustics. In 1939, when Fubini at the age of 60 was nearing retirement, Benito Mussolini's Fascists adopted the anti-Jewish policies advocated for several years by Adolf Hitler's Nazis. As a Jew, Fubini feared for the safety of his family, and so accepted an invitation by Princeton University to teach there; he died in New York City four years later. A main belt asteroid, 22495 Fubini, was named in his honour.

Abbas Kiarostami (22 June 1940 – 4 July 2016) was an Iranian film director, screenwriter, poet, photographer, and film producer. An active film-maker from 1970, Kiarostami had been involved in the production of over forty films, including shorts and documentaries. Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the Koker trilogy (1987–1994), Close-Up (1990) , The Wind Will Carry Us (1999), and Taste of Cherry (1997), which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year. In later works, Certified Copy (2010) and Like Someone in Love (2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran: in Italy and Japan, respectively. His films Where Is the Friend’s Home?Close-Up, and The Wind Will Carry Us were ranked among the 100 best foreign films in a 2018 critics' poll by BBC Culture. Close-Up was also ranked one of the 50 greatest movies of all time in the famous decennial Sight & Sound poll conducted in 2012. Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter, film editor, art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material. He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and graphic designer. He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave, a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as Bahram Beyzai, Nasser Taghvai, Ali Hatami, Masoud Kimiai, Dariush Mehrjui, Sohrab Shahid-Saless and Parviz Kimiavi. These filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues. Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary-style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works.

Diane De Courcy is a Canadian politician. She was a Parti Québécois member of the National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of Crémazie from 2012 to 2014, first elected in the 2012 election. Prior to entering the National Assembly, De Courcy was funding President of the Commission scolaire de Montreal for the Mouvement pour une école moderne et ouverte. Following the 2012 election, De Courcy immediately entered Cabinet as Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities and, most importantly, Minister Responsible for the Charter of the French Language. In this capacity, she has been a central figure in the debate surrounding Bill 14, a proposed piece of legislation that would amend the Charter of the French Language( Bill 101). De Courcy was defeated in the 2014 election, which saw the PQ reduced to 30 seats across the province and hold on to only 4 seats on the Island of Montreal. One possible reason for De Courcy's defeat in Crémazie was the backlash to the Quebec Charter of Values, which was highly unpopular among the large immigrant population in the riding.

He began his career in Vladivostok directing music videos for Russian acts such as Mumiy Troll and Zemfira before relocating to Moscow. He is best known in Russia for the Internet-based hype surrounding his first feature film Dead Daughters, where he tried to marry horror and arthouse cinema effectively.

Raymundo Gleyzer( September 25, 1941, Buenos Aires- missing since May 27, 1976) was an Argentine political filmmaker. He specialized in documentaries. He was disappeared as an opponent of the military dictatorship, and most likely murdered. Born into a Jewish family, Gleyzer became interested in politics and film early on. All his films he put into the service of the fight against social injustice and for the revolution. He made his first film in the backward northeast of Brazil, where he barely escaped imminent death. In the early 1970s he made a film in Mexico about the so- called institutionalized revolution of the PRI ruling party. The film was banned in Argentina at first, but found a lively echo in Mexico among the students. In 1973 he co-founded the Cine de la Base group, which organized demonstrations and discussions with workers( i.e. outside the cinema industry). His last major film, Los traidores( The Traitors), presents his critique of the Peronist political movement, which played an important role in Argentina in 1973. The film depicts how union leaders have allied themselves with entrepreneurs, the military and the US to maintain their personal power and enrich themselves. On May 27, 1976, Gleyzer was abducted and tortured, by a death squad of the military government that had come to power two months earlier, and never seen again. He is thus one of the tens of thousands of desaparecidos( disappeared) of the Argentine military dictatorship, most of which were secretly murdered. Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff created a cartoon dedicated to Gleyzer and the violently disappeared people of Latin America.

A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 2010 American slasher film directed by Samuel Bayer, and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer. The film stars Jackie Earle Haley, Kyle Gallner, Rooney Mara, Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz. It is a remake of Wes Craven's 1984 film of the same name. Produced by Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes, the film was designed to reboot the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and is the ninth installment in the series. The film is set in a fictitious town of Ohio and centers around a group of teenagers living on one street who are stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named Freddy Krueger. The teenagers discover that they all share a common link from their childhood that makes them targets for Krueger. In January 2008, Variety reported that Bay and his Platinum Dunes production company would be rebooting the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise with a remake of the original 1984 film.  A Nightmare on Elm Street was originally to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, where the writers took the best elements from each of the films in the original series and created a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline but tried to create a scarier film. To that end, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring back his darker nature. The writers developed the character to be a child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead. Freddy's physical appearance was changed with the use of computer-generated imagery to be closer to that of a burn victim. Because of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes' producers had in the area, A Nightmare on Elm Street was filmed primarily in Illinois. Craven expressed his displeasure when he was not consulted on the project. Robert Englund, who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy. A Nightmare on Elm Street was produced by New Line Cinema and had its world premiere at Hollywood on April 27, 2010, and was theatrically released in North America on April 30, 2010, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the teenage characters and story while offering some praise for Bayer's direction and Haley's performance. Regardless, A Nightmare on Elm Street broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film and grossed more in its opening weekend than the total gross of four other Nightmare on Elm Street films. The film earned over $63 million at the domestic box office and over $115 million worldwide.

A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American slasher film written and directed by Wes Craven, and produced by Robert Shaye. It is the first installment in the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series and stars Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, and Johnny Depp in his film debut. The plot concerns four teenagers living on one street in the fictitious town of Springwood, Ohio, who are invaded and killed in their dreams, and thus killed in reality, by a burnt killer with a bladed leather glove. Craven filmed A Nightmare on Elm Street on an estimated budget of$ 1.8 million, a sum the film earned back during its first week. The film was released on November 9, 1984, where it went on to gross over$ 25 million at the United States box office.  A Nightmare on Elm Street was met with rave critical reviews and is considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, spawning a franchise consisting of six sequels, a television series, a crossover with Friday the 13th, and various other merchandise. A remake of the same name was released in 2010. The film is credited with using many of the tropes found in the low- budget horror films of the 1970s and 1980s that originated with John Carpenter's Halloween( 1978) and led this subgenre to be called the slasher film. The film includes a morality play where sexually promiscuous teenagers are killed. Critics and film historians state that the film's premise is the struggle to define the distinction between dreams and reality, manifested by the lives and dreams of the teens in the film. Critics today praise the film's ability to transgress the boundaries between the imaginary and real, toying with audience perceptions. The film was followed by.

Cradle of Fear is a 2001 British horror film, directed by Alex Chandon. It was released direct- to- video on 4 July 2001. Taking inspiration from the anthology films produced by Amicus Productions in the 1970s, it features three separate half- hour segments, linked by a fourth story. The main narrative involves imprisoned serial killer Kemper wreaking vengeance on those responsible for his capture. This he does through his son: Dani Filth playing an unnamed character referred to in the credits as The Man. Shot on video and on a very low budget, the film received a lukewarm reception in the horror press, and is chiefly of interest to Cradle of Filth fans, as it features the entire lineup( principally Dani, but the rest crop up in cameo roles) from the band's Midian era. Chandon's association with Cradle of Filth began with the promo video for From the Cradle to Enslave, and he went on to direct the clips for Her Ghost in the Fog and No Time to Cry, plus some DVD documentaries. Kemper is played by David McEwen, who also appeared in the video for Her Ghost in the Fog, miming to Doug Bradley's narration.

The film tells the story of Alex Rogan( Lance Guest), a teenager recruited by an alien defense force to fight in an interstellar war. It also features Robert Preston, Dan O' Herlihy, Catherine Mary Stewart, Norman Snow, and Kay E. Kuter.  The Last Starfighter, along with Disney's Tron, has the distinction of being one of cinema's earliest films to use extensive computer- generated imagery( CGI) to depict its many starships, environments and battle scenes. It is one of the first films to use CGI to represent real- life objects instead of digital imaging.  The Last Starfighter was Preston's final role on the big screen( though he did cameos in TV movies afterwards until his death in 1987). His character, a lovable con-man, was a nod to his most famous role as Harold Hill in The Music Man. There was a subsequent novelization of the film by Alan Dean Foster, as well as a video game based on the production. In 2004, it was also adapted as an off- Broadway musical.

The Starfighters is a 1964 American film. It was written and directed by Will Zens and stars Bob Dornan, Richard Jordahl and Richard Masters.

Requiem for a Gunfighter is a 1965 American western film, the last picture directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet, produced by Alex Gordon, and starring Rod Cameron, Stephen McNally, Mike Mazurki, Dick Jones, and Olive Sturgess. Olive Sturgess recalls that Cameron, who had starred in three syndicated television series between 1954 and 1961, was making sort of a comeback at this time. He was very gracious; very kind. You can see it in him in the scene when we are having dinner—his look. He was a professional.  Requiem used several older actors, including Tim McCoy. Dick Jones, years earlier the voice of Pinocchio, closed his acting career in the film as the gunfighter, Cliff Fletcher. Mike Mazurki brought humor to the picture. The snake which he placed in the saddlebag of Cameron's horse was artificial but made so real- looking that viewers would not have known the difference.

She became known as a democrat and a pacifist in her work and was a friend of president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. In 1938, she returned to Sweden after an order for her arrest had been issued by the Gestapo. In 1940, she was one of the founders of the discussionclub Tisdagsklubben (The Tuesday Club) in Stockholm. It was formally a discussion-club about culture, but its true purpose was to work against the expansion of nazism in Sweden. The club was in fact inaugurated the same day Nazi Germany occupied Norway, the 9 April 1940. Tisdagsklubben was to be used as the center of the Swedish resistance movement in the case Sweden was ever occupied by Nazi Germany. Amelie Posse was, like other members of the club, listed in German records as Untrustworthy Swedes. A tiny museum with Amelie Posse memorabilia can be found at Örenäs slott, close to Posse's childhood home (torn down), near Landskrona in south Sweden.

Wong Kar-wai (born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama  As Tears Go By (1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles. Days of Being Wild (1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express (1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

Random Harvest is a 1942 film based on the 1941 James Hilton novel of the same name, directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Claudine West, George Froeschel, and Arthur Wimperis adapted the novel for the screen, and received an Academy Award nomination. The novel keeps the true identity of Paula/ Margaret a secret until the very end, something that would have been impossible in a film, where characters ’ faces must be seen. This meant that the movie had to take a very different approach to the story. The film stars Ronald Colman as a shellshocked, amnesiac World War I soldier, and Greer Garson as his love interest. It was an instant commercial success. Its seven Oscar nominations included nods for Colman, supporting actress Susan Peters, director Mervyn LeRoy, and Best Picture. Garson, whose performance was well- received, was ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Actress, as she had already been nominated that year for her role in Mrs. Miniver.

1001,"Maatkare B was a wife of pharaoh Osorkon I and the mother of the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C. Maatkare was the daughter of Psusennes II (also known as Pasebkhanut II). Maatkare is known from several sources. Her statuette of which only the base with a pair of feet is preserved (Marseille, Musée Borély no. 432) may be a re-used New Kingdom piece. A statue of the Nile-god - now in the British Museum (BM 8) - was dedicated by his son Shoshenq C, and he lists his parents as Osorkon I and Maatkare. Maatkare is called the King's Daughter of ... Har-Psusennes II, beloved of Amun. On a statue from the Karnak Cachette (Cairo Museum CG 42194), also dedicated by her son Shoshenq, Maatkare has the titles Prophetess of Hathor, Lady of Dendera, God's Mother of Harsomtus, and King's Daughter.

Shepseskare or Shepseskara (Egyptian for Noble is the Soul of Ra) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty (2494–2345 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.

Ankhesenpepi IV was an ancient Egyptian queen, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi II of the Sixth dynasty. She was the mother of King Neferkare II. Pepi II also had several other wives.

Shepseskaf was the sixth and last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. He reigned 6 to 8 years starting circa 2510 BC. The only activities firmly datable to his reign are the completion of the temple complex of the Pyramid of Menkaure and the construction of its own mastaba tomb at South Saqqara, the Mastabat al-Fir’aun, stone bench of the pharaoh.

Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30–35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.

Set in interwar France, the film follows the story of a suicidal amnesiac( Ingrid Bergman), whose remarkable resemblance to the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia — the youngest daughter of the late Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, who is rumored to have survived the execution of her family — draws her into a plot devised by the former Russian White General Bounine( Yul Brynner) and his associates to swindle from the Grand Duchess an inheritance of £ 10 million.

1020,"Flavia Julia Constantia (after 293 – c. 330) was the daughter of the Roman Emperor Constantius Chlorus and his second wife, Flavia Maximiana Theodora. In 313, Emperor Constantine the Great, who was the half-brother of Constantia, gave her in marriage to his co-emperor Licinius, on occasion of their meeting in Mediolanum. She bore a son, Valerius Licinianus Licinius, in 315, and when the struggle between Constantine and Licinius began in 316, she stayed on her husband's side. A second war started between the two emperors in 324; after Licinius' defeat, Constantia interceded with Constantine for her husband's life. Constantine spared Licinius' life, and obliged him to live in Thessalonica as a private citizen, but the following year (325), he ordered that Licinius be killed. A second blow for Constantia was the death, also by order of Constantine, of her son Valerius. In the following years, Constantia lived at her brother's court, receiving honors (her title was nobilissima femina). Constantia was her brother's favourite sister and proof of such favour is that he minted coins with her image and with the title Constantia Soror Constantini AVG, or, Constantia, Sister of Constantine AugustusAVG is an abbreviation of Augustus, the center consonant being a manuscript U, not a V). She converted to Christianity, supporting the Arian party at the First Council of Nicaea (325). The city of Constana, Romania is named after her.

Flavia Maxima Constantia (361/362 – 383) was the first empress consort of Gratian of the Western Roman Empire. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, Constantia was a posthumous child of Constantius II by his third wife Faustina. Her paternal grandparents were Constantine the Great and Fausta.

Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina (c. 151-after 165) was the eldest child of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and his wife, Faustina the Younger. Her younger sister was Lucilla and her younger brother was Commodus. Her maternal grandparents were Antoninus Pius and Faustina the Elder, while her paternal grandparents were Domitia Lucilla and praetor Marcus Annius Verus. She was born and raised in Rome. The parents of Faustina betrothed her to Gnaeus Claudius Severus, whom she later married after 159. Gnaeus Claudius Severus was a Roman Senator of Pontian Greek descent that came from Pompeiopolis, a city in the Roman province of Galatia. After Faustina married Claudius Severus, they settled in Pompeiopolis. Faustina bore Claudius Severus a son, Tiberius Claudius Severus Proculus, who served as consul in 200.

Junia Calvina was a Roman noblewoman who lived in the 1st century AD. The daughter of Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, Calvina belonged to two patrician houses: the gens Aemilia and gens Junia respectively. She was also the great-great-granddaughter of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus on her mother's side of the Imperial family. As such, she was also related by blood to the gens Julia, the aristocratic family of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar. Tacitus calls Calvina festivissima puella and the Emperor Vespasian, in one of his jokes, mentions her as living in AD 79. Seneca describes her as most celebrated of all women (she whom all called Venus). Calvina was married to Lucius Vitellius, the brother of Aulus Vitellius, in the 1st century AD. Despite, or rather because of their blood relation to the first emperor of Rome, Calvina's close family was often persecuted by their kinsmen, particularly the lineal descendants of Livia Drusilla, Augustus' third wife and the first Roman empress. Calvina and Vitellius were divorced in AD 49 following allegations of incest with her younger brother, Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus, who was forced to commit suicide shortly thereafter. In the same year, Calvina was exiled from Rome by Emperor Claudius, only to be recalled a decade later by his successor, Nero. With Nero's suicide in AD 68, the Julio-Claudian dynasty collapsed and gave way to the Roman civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. By then Calvina was one of Augustus' few remaining descendants who survived the fall of Rome's first Imperial dynasty.

Scribonia( c. 70 BC – c. 16 AD) was the second wife of Octavian, later the Roman Emperor Augustus, and the mother of his only natural child, Julia the Elder. Through her youngest daughter she was the mother- in- law of the Emperor Tiberius, great- grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, and great- great grandmother of the Emperor Nero.

He may have been married to Clementia of Aquitaine, although that proposed marriage seems to be based on a falsified document. It is also possible that he married an unnamed daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy. Gerard had three children:

Gerard III of Guelders (1185 – 22 October 1229) was the Count of Guelders and Zutphen from 1207 until his death in 1229. He was a son of Count Otto I of Guelders, and is sometimes called Gerard IV or Gerard V. He married Margaretha of Brabant, the daughter of Duke Hendrik I of Brabant, in 1206.

He was, between 1098 and 1100, dispossessed by his cousin Philippa and her husband Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who marched into Toulouse and captured it. Later they mortgaged it back to Bertrand in 1100 to fund Duke William's expedition to the Holy Land. Bertrand officially became count of Toulouse when Raymond died in 1105, and in 1108 he headed to Tripoli to take control there as well. He deposed Raymond's nephew William-Jordan as nominal count of Tripoli in 1109, and with Baldwin I, king of Jerusalem, and a fleet of Genoese ships he captured Tripoli on 12 July. Bertrand married in June 1095, Helie of Burgundy, daughter of Eudes I.Bertrand ruled in Tripoli until his death in 1112.

Through the marriage between the earl and Georgina Bertie, the ancient hereditary office of Lord Great Chamberlain( which had been held by her brother, Robert Bertie, 4th Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, until his death in 1779) passed into the Cholmondeley family. Georgina's son George Cholmondeley, 2nd Marquess of Cholmondeley, shared the position. In 1795, the marchioness( then still a countess) was appointed a Lady of the Bedchamber to the Princess of Wales.

1025,"Maria of Brunswick- Wolfenbüttel( born: 13 January 1566 in Schladen; died: 13 August 1626 in Lauenburg) was a princess of Brunswick- Wolfenbüttel by birth and by marriage Duchess of Saxe- Lauenburg.

Maria of Jülich-Berg (3 August 1491 – 29 August 1543) was born in Jülich, the daughter of Wilhelm IV, Duke of Jülich-Berg and Sibylle of Brandenburg. Maria came from the line of German princesses that stretched back to Sybille of Brandenberg, Sophia of Saxony, and Adelaide of Teck. Maria became heiress to her father's estates of Jülich, Berg and Ravensberg after his death in 1511. In her marriage to John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509, Maria's estates and titles were eventually merged with the Duchy of Cleves. John, who inherited the Duchy of Cleves-Mark in 1521, then became the first ruler of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, which would exist until 1666. She married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509, by whom she had three daughters and a son. Sybille (1512–1554), William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (Wilhelm) (1516–1592), Amalia (1517–1586), and Anne (1515–1557) who was Queen consort of England from 6 January 1540 to 9 July 1540 to King Henry VIII. Maria was a strict, traditional Catholic and not a proponent of educating princesses and noble women, which by this point was the norm for the English nobility and gentry. In The Wives of Henry VIII, Antonia Fraser suggests that, following their marriage, one reason Henry VIII disliked her daughter Anne so much was that, unlike his first two wives and many of the court ladies around him, Anne did not possess educational and musical accomplishments and was ill-equipped to function in the contentious English court. Duchess Maria herself appears not to have favored sending her daughter to England. She wrote in a later correspondence she loved her daughter so much that she was 'loath to suffer her to depart her'.

Barbara Fugger (1419 – July 23, 1497) was a German businessperson and banker. Barbara Baesinger was born to a wealthy family in Augsburg, Germany.

She successfully managed the family business and eventually traded internationally in linen and wool. She provided money for her sons' businesses and her daughters' dowries. After the death of her spouse in 1469, she managed the Fugger bank until her death in 1497. She was assisted by her sons, but they did not gain full access until after her death.

1026,"Rauni Mollberg (April 15, 1929 – October 11, 2007) was a Finnish film director who directed movies and TV movies. In 1963 Mollberg directed movies for YLE. He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera. Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song (1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically-charged, blood-soaked tale of a young village girl's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality (Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture (Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and independent festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles. During his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film  The Earth is a Sinful Song (1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier (1985) making it the 17th highest-grossing movie in the history of Finland.

Ravikant Nagaich( 5 July 1931 – 6 January 1991, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu) was an Indian film personality born at Atrauli, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India in a Brahmin family. He started his filming career as a cinematographer in Telugu films, N.T. Rama Rao's Sri Seetha Rama Kalyanam in 1961 being his first film. With Farz, he turned to Hindi movies and direction. This low- budget thriller inspired by James Bond was a surprise hit and helped Ravikant and the film's lead pair's( Jeetendra and Babita) career. Dharmendra acted as Agent 116 Gopal in Keemat( 1973). Jeetendra reprised his role as Agent 116, Gopalkishan Pandey in Raksha( 1982) and again in The Gold Medal( 1984). He went on to direct 24 more films Duty being his last. Though he had some big budget hits like Mere Jeevan Saathi and The Train( 1970 film), his low budget fare such as Surakshaa and Wardaat- again in the secret agent mode like Farz, Keemat and Raksha- are his remembered hits due to the tacky stunts and special effects and the fact that despite these drawbacks the films did well. Mithun Chakravorty too benefitted from Surakshaa to move to commercial films as Jeetendra had earlier with Farz. He also produced two films in the 1980s: Wardaat and Shapath.

Where did Louisa Garrett Anderson's mother die?",shimla india,aldeburgh,0.09522125869989395,0.0,False
1027,"Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson, CBE (28 July 1873 – 15 November 1943) was a medical pioneer, a member of the Women's Social and Political Union, a suffragette, and social reformer. She was the daughter of the founding medical pioneer Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, whom she wrote a biography of in 1939. Louisa was the Chief Surgeon of the Women's Hospital Corps (WHC) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. Her aunt, Dame Millicent Fawcett, was a British suffragist. Louisa Garrett Anderson never married.

Sadie Crawford (1885–1965), also known as Sadie Johnson and Sadie Mozee, was a British-American performer of the early jazz era, one of the few white female performers of her day to have enjoyed an international career. Based for the last 35 years of her life in Washington, D.C., United States, she was born Louisa Harriet Marshall in Tooting, London on 27 December 1885. The youngest of the seven children of Francis Thomas Marshall and his wife Ellen Maria, she maintained a close bond with her siblings and their families throughout her life. The household in which she grew up was a somewhat unconventional one: her father, a removal-man, died just before her fifth birthday, and shortly afterwards her mother Ellen began a relationship with a man some 20 years her junior, Louis Slade, with whom in 1892 she went on to have one further child. Ellen and Louis finally married in 1905, four years before Ellen’s death. Most of Louisa’s siblings lived their adult lives in south London. Throughout her life she remained particularly close to her eldest sister Mrs Rhoda Matilda Newbon, who was mother to 13 children. Sadie took to the stage in London in her mid teens, and it is clear that early on she developed a taste for black popular culture, and music in particular. She would marry twice; both her husbands were black Americans. Numerous photographs show she presented herself as a 'black', 'coloured' or 'creole' woman and several newspaper articles also suggest that her origins were more exotic than they really were. Throughout her career she seems to have used professionally the forename Sadie, although the origins of this stage name are not known. Various sources allow us to piece together Sadie’s career. Not least among these is a short account of her life that she herself wrote in 1960 in her mid 70s. From this we learn that she left school at 11 (working initially as a domestic servant) and within a few years was employed as a dancer at London’s Empire Theatre. Her first big break came with an invitation from the American entertainer Laura Hampton (née Bowman) to join her review troupe, following which she was signed up for a European tour of the show 'A Trip to Coontown'. Sadie met her first husband, saxophonist Adolph Crawford, in 1906 and was soon working with him as a vaudeville music hall double act, although at this time she was using the name Sadie Johnson. In the years leading up to the First World War the duo can be found performing in Russia, Bucharest, the Balkan States and Scandinavia, as well as Berlin and Paris, and in the war years all corners of the United Kingdom. Sadie and Adolph finally married in Southwark in June 1918, just as the jazz craze was sweeping across Europe. Their international careers started to take off in earnest at this time, with invitations to tour the world pouring in. In the post-war years they can be found as far afield as New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, in addition to Austria, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Paris, very much the European capital of jazz with so many resident and ad hoc bands and orchestras, became an important base for the duo. It was in Paris in 1923 that the few recordings to feature them (as part of Gordon Stretton’s ‘Orchestre Syncopated Six’) were made by Pathé; it was also at the American Hospital of Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, that Adolph Crawford died in 1929. Within a few months of Adolph's death Sadie sailed to New York City with Lew Leslie's ‘Blackbirds’ and it was in the United States that she thereafter settled. After suffering a nervous breakdown she was advised to go to Saratoga Springs to recuperate and it was there she met her second husband Frank Mozee (a chauffeur, some 16 years younger than she was), whom she married in 1930, when she would have been 44. Sadie and Frank made their home in Washington D.C. and it seems that her second marriage effectively marked the end of her stage career. From America she regularly visited her family back in Tooting (in the early years by boat but latterly by plane), staying at the Regent Palace Hotel in central London. Although she had no children of her own, Sadie was ‘foster mother’ to a daughter, Lillian Brown. Sadie Mozee died at Washington’s District of Columbia General Hospital on 18 December 1965, a few days short of her 80th birthday, the Washington Evening Star revealing in her obituary notice that her death occurred ‘after a long illness’. The article also states that she was a member of St Martin’s Catholic Church and that she is buried in Washington's Mount Olivet Cemetery. Her husband Frank died in Washington D.C. in 1981.

Lizzie Andrew Borden( July 19, 1860 – June 1, 1927) was an American woman who was the main suspect in the August 4, 1892, axe murders of her father and stepmother in Fall River, Massachusetts. Borden was tried and acquitted of the murders. The case was a cause célèbre and received widespread newspaper coverage throughout the United States. Following her release from jail, where she was held during the trial, Borden chose to remain a resident of Fall River despite facing ostracism from the other residents. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts elected not to charge anyone else with the murder of Andrew and Abby Borden. Even though the crimes occurred, speculation about the crimes continues. She spent the remainder of her life in Fall River before dying of pneumonia, aged 66, just days before the death of her sister, Emma. Borden and her association with the murders has remained a topic in American popular culture mythology into the 21st century, and she has been depicted in various films, theatrical productions, literary works, and folk rhymes.

Philip Kaufman (born October 23, 1936) is an American film director and screenwriter who has directed fifteen films over a career spanning more than six decades. He has been described as a maverick and an iconoclast, notable for his versatility and independence. He is considered an auteur, whose films have always expressed his personal vision. Kaufman's works have included genres such as realism, horror, fantasy, erotica, Westerns, underworld crime, and inner city gangs. His choice of topics has been eclectic and sometimes controversial, having adapted novels with diverse themes and stories. Examples are Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), Michael Crichton's Rising Sun (1993), a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), and the erotic writings of Anaïs Nin's Henry & June. His film The Wanderers (1979) has achieved cult status. But his greatest success was Tom Wolfe's true-life The Right Stuff, which received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. According to film historian Annette Insdorf, no other living American director has so consistently and successfully made movies for adults, tackling sensuality, artistic creation, and manipulation by authorities. Other critics note that Kaufman's films are strong on mood and atmosphere, with powerful cinematography and a lyrical, poetic style to portray different historic periods. His later films have a somewhat European style, but the stories always stress individualism and integrity, and are clearly American.

1040,"A Countess from Hong Kong is a 1967 British romantic comedy film written, scored, and directed by Charlie Chaplin and starring Marlon Brando, Sophia Loren, Sydney Chaplin( Chaplin's third son), Tippi Hedren, Patrick Cargill and Margaret Rutherford. It was the last film directed, written, produced and scored by Chaplin, and one of two films Chaplin directed in which he did not play a major role( the other was 1923's A Woman of Paris), as well as his only color film. Chaplin's cameo marked his final screen appearance. The story is based loosely on the life of a woman Chaplin met in France, named Moussia Sodskaya, or Skaya, as he calls her in his 1922 book My Trip Abroad. She was a Russian singer and dancer who was a stateless person marooned in France without a passport. The idea, according to a press release written by Chaplin after the film received a negative reception, resulted from a visit I made to Shanghai in 1931 where I came across a number of titled aristocrats who had escaped the Russian Revolution. They were destitute and without a country, their status was of the lowest grade. The men ran rickshaws and the women worked in ten -cent dance halls. When the Second World War broke out many of the old aristocrats had died and the younger generation migrated to Hong Kong where their plight was even worse, for Hong Kong was overcrowded with refugees. It was originally started as a film called Stowaway in the 1930s, planned for Paulette Goddard, but production was never completed. This resulting film, created nearly 30 years after its inception, was a critical failure and grossed US$ 2 million from a US$3.5- million budget. However, it did prove to be extremely successful in Europe and Japan. In addition, the success of the music score was able to cover the budget. Critics such as Tim Hunter and Andrew Sarris, as well as poet John Betjeman and director François Truffaut, viewed the film as being among Chaplin's best works. Actor Jack Nicholson is also a big fan of the film. The film's theme song, This Is My Song, written by Chaplin and performed by Petula Clark, became a worldwide success, topping the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, while reaching number three in the United States and number four in Canada.

Naked Hearts is a 1966 French drama film directed by Édouard Luntz. It was entered into the 16th Berlin International Film Festival. The film tells the story of a group of young people from Nanterre, a suburb to the west of Paris. The main characters, Zim and Jean- Pierre, are part of a gang of greasers( referred to in French as « blousons noirs »), and meet in prison at the beginning of the film. The narrative traces their efforts to negotiate the dynamics of the group, find a job, and stay out of trouble( both are on provisional release after their initial brush with the law).

Forman based his story on a real- world incident from his past and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on trying to create a real- life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary- style cinematographic techniques.

In the early 1930s, he was a member of the Workers Film and Photo League, and later, Frontier Films. He made films for the Rockefeller Foundation and other academic institutions, becoming a film editor and second- unit director involved with the emerging American documentary movement of the late 1930s.

John Marcellus Huston (August 5, 1906 – August 28, 1987) was an American film director, screenwriter, actor, and visual artist. Huston was a citizen of the United States by birth but renounced U.S. citizenship to become an Irish citizen and resident. He returned to the United States, where he lived the rest of his life. He wrote the screenplays for most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics: The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The African Queen (1951), The Misfits (1961), Fat City (1972), The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and Prizzi's Honor (1986). During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, winning twice, and directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston, to Oscar wins. Huston studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris in his early years. He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career, sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, with little editing needed. Some of Huston's films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting an heroic quest, as in Moby Dick, or The Red Badge of Courage. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed, forming destructive alliances, giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his films involved themes such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, and war. Huston has been referred to as a titana rebel, and a renaissance man in the Hollywood film industry. Author Ian Freer describes him as cinema's Ernest Hemingway—a filmmaker who was never afraid to tackle tough issues head on.

The careers of both Gassman and Mastroianni were considerably helped by the success of the film, Gassman in particular, since before then he was not deemed suitable for comedic roles. Claudia Cardinale featured in a minor role( a chaste, black- clad Sicilian girl, almost held prisoner at home by her overbearing brother, played by Murgia); she would later rise to fame for other work. The film is also notable for its breezy jazz score by composer Piero Umiliani, who helped develop the style of the jazz soundtracks now considered characteristic of European films in the 1960s and 1970s. The producers were initially skeptical about the film's success, and to boost audience interest highlighted the appearance of the famous comedian Totò in the original poster even though his character chooses to remain a consultant to the heist gang rather than joining it outright. The film is distributed in Region 1 by The Criterion Collection and for the Italian market in Region 2 by 20th Century Fox.

Screenwriter, film director and author, Cristóbal Krusen was born and raised in Tampa, Florida. While an English major at Harvard University, he intended pursuing a career as a novelist and poet. A growing interest in photography and the history of cinema, however, led him to simultaneously explore the world of filmmaking. Eventually, he changed his major and schools, graduating from New York University (BFA, Film and Television) in 1976. That same year he started working in New York City with a small production company making commercials and industrial films. In the years that followed, Cristóbal worked for other New York-based companies in a range of capacities, including script reader, film editor, writer, and finally director/producer. In the mid-1980s, Cristóbal began to focus on Spanish-language productions for U.S.-based relief agencies and Christian ministries outside of the USA. In 1988 he founded Messenger Films, and produced his first dramatic film, the award-winning Ropa Nueva para FelipeNew Clothes for Felipe). In 1989 Cristóbal earned his MFA at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. Reflecting the international orientation of his work, Cristóbal has won awards at major film festivals in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tanzania, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico and Cuba.

I Graduated, But... () is a 1929 Japanese silent film directed by Yasujir Ozu. The film is now lost, except for an excerpt of approximately 10 minutes. Ozu's friend and coworker Hiroshi Shimizu, who co-wrote the script, was originally slated to direct the film. Shimizu's wife Kinuyo Tanaka starred in the film. The plot involved a young man (Minoru Takada) who turns down a receptionist job after graduating college because he feels it isn't good enough for him, but needs to fool his mother (Utako Suzuki) and fiancee (Tanaka) into thinking he has a job. After he marries the fiancee he has to admit to her that he is unemployed so she takes a job in a bar. After an argument with her he apologizes for being irresponsible. He goes back to the company he turned down to accept the receptionist job, but they give him a salaried position instead. A poster from Harold Lloyd's silent comedy Speedy is used as a prop in the film. One visual gag in the film occurs when the man is apologizing to his wife and suddenly slaps her head, but it is then revealed that he was killing a mosquito. According to Donald Richie, Ozu's 1930 film  I Flunked, But... was based in part on this film. To David Bordwell I Was Flunked, But... presents the opposite situation to this film, in that the protagonist does not graduate and so does not have to face unemployment. Both films reflect a theme that runs through several of Ozu's films of the period, that of youth unemployment in Japan at the time. Akira Iwasaki described Ozu's films in the period starting with this film and extending to  I Was Born, But...  as having more directly depicted the psychological depression of the 'dark period' than any other films.  A Kinema Jumpo critic complained that the film's playfulness was jarring and that the happy ending detracted from the social message. Bordwell commented on the symmetry in the construction of the film, including how it begins and ends with scenes at the company office with opposite results, and how at first the man pretends to a job when he does not but later his fiancee pretends not to have one when she does.

High School is a 1968 American documentary film directed by Frederick Wiseman that shows a typical day for a group of students at Northeast High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was one of the first direct cinema( or cinéma vérité) documentaries. It was shot over five weeks in March and April 1968. The film was not shown in Philadelphia at the time of its release, because of Wiseman's concerns over what he called vague talk of a lawsuit. The film was released in November 1968 by Zipporah Films, Wiseman's distribution company.  High School has aired on PBS. Wiseman distributes his work( DVDs and 16 mm prints) through Zipporah Films, which rents them to high schools, colleges, and libraries on a five- year long- term lease.  High School was selected in 1991 for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1994, Wiseman released High School II, a second documentary on high school, based on Central Park East Secondary School in New York City.

1100,"Countess Karoline Ernestine of Erbach- Schönberg, born 20 August 1727( 20 July, according to other sources) at Gedern, Oberhessen, Hesse- Darmstadt, in the then Holy Roman Empire, was a daughter of George August, Count of Erbach- Schönberg, and Ferdinande Henriette, Countess of Stolberg- Gedern. She died at Ebersdorf, Thuringia, on 22 April 1796, at age 68. Through her daughter Augusta, she was the great grandmother of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

Princess Hilda of Luxembourg( 15 February 1897, Berg Castle, Colmar- Berg, Luxembourg – 8 September 1979, Berg Castle, Colmar- Berg, Luxembourg) was a Princess of Luxembourg by birth and the Princess of Schwarzenberg by marriage.

Marie of Luxembourg (1304 – 26 March 1324), was by birth member of the House of Luxembourg and by marriage Queen of France and Navarre. She was the daughter of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and Margaret of Brabant. Her two siblings were John of Luxembourg and Beatrice of Luxembourg, Queen of Hungary.

Magdalena of Saxony (7 March 1507 – 25 January 1534) was Margravine of Brandenburg, its Electoral Princess, the Electoral equivalent of a crown princess. She was the daughter of George the Bearded, Duke of Saxony and his wife Barbara. Magdalena's maternal grandparents were Kazimierz IV Jagiellon and his wife queen Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Albert II of Germany. She was a granddaughter of the Elisabeth aforementioned,mother of the Jagiellonians, queen of Poland, who had claimed the Duchy of Luxembourg in 1460s as being the younger daughter of the last Luxembourg heiress Elisabeth of Luxembourg, Queen of Bohemia. Though by no means an heiress of her grandmother, she was intended to wed the heir of her grandmother's older sister. Joachim (1505–1571), the future elector of Brandenburg, was the eldest son and heir of their current claimant of Luxembourg, Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg (1484–1535), the eldest son and heir of Margaret of Thuringia (1449–1501), Dowager Electress of Brandenburg, herself the eldest daughter and heiress of Anna, Duchess of Luxembourg and William of Saxony, Landgrave of Thuringia. Magdalena was thus married, at Dresden, on 6 November 1524, to her second cousin's son Joachim Hector, the future Elector of Brandenburg. Their son was John George, another future Elector of Brandenburg. After Magdalena's death which occurred well before Joachim ascended the electorate, Joachim II Hector married Hedwig Jagiellon, daughter of King Sigismund I of Poland.

She was a daughter of the 1841 marriage of Count Leopold von Wartensleben (1818-1846) with Mathilde Halbach (1822-1844), daughter of Arnold Halbach, an American industrialist whose family fortune became important in German munitions, but the question of her hereditary rank became an important issue in a 1905 dispute over succession to the throne of the principality of Lippe.

Who is the stepchild of Æthelred Of Mercia?",ælfwynn of mercia,oshere,0.39849522709846497,0.0,False
1101,"Ælfwynn was the ruler of Mercia for a few months in 918, following her mother's death on 12 June 918. She was the daughter of Æthelred, ruler of English Mercia, and Æthelflæd( styled The Lady of Mercia). The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle states that she was deprived of all control in Mercia, and was led into Wessex three weeks before Christmas. Her accession was the only example of rule passing from one woman to another in the early medieval period in the British Isles.

Æthelswith (c. 838–888) was the only known daughter of King Æthelwulf of Wessex. She became Queen Æthelswith when she married King Burgred of Mercia in 853. The couple had no issue. Her marriage probably signalled the subordination of Burgred to his father-in-law and the Saxon kingdom at a time when both Wessex and Mercia were suffering Danish (Viking) raids. Burgred also had ongoing problems with the Kingdom of Powys on his western border and in 853 Æthelwulf subjugated the Welsh state on Burgred's behalf. Repeated Danish incursions over the years gradually weakened Mercia militarily and in 868 Burgred was forced to call upon Æthelswith's brother King Æthelred of Wessex to assist him in confronting an entrenched Danish army at Nottingham. This was the last time the Saxons came to the aid of the Mercians and is also notable as the occasion on which Alfred the Great, another brother of Æthelswith's, married his Mercian wife Ealhswith. Burgred's reign lasted till 874 when the Vikings drove him from the kingdom and he fled to Rome with Æthelswith. He died shortly after. Æthelswith lived on in Italy, to be buried at Pavia in 888.

Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians (870 – 12 June 918) ruled Mercia in the English Midlands from 911 until her death. She was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great, king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith. Æthelflæd was born around 870 at the height of the Viking invasions of England. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule – East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered, and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings – but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people not living in areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying Æthelflæd to Æthelred. Æthelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with Æthelflæd's brother, the future King Edward the Elder. Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified Worcester, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built a new minster in Gloucester. Æthelred's health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that Æthelflæd was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern Danelaw. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint, Oswald, which were translated to the new Gloucester minster. Æthelred died in 911 and Æthelflæd then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as one of the most unique events in early medieval history. Alfred had built a network of fortified burhs and in the 910s Edward and Æthelflæd embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were Wednesbury, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as her greatest triumph. In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. Æthelflæd was succeeded by her daughter Ælfwynn, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried Ælfwynn off to Wessex. Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under Æthelred and Æthelflæd but they agree that Æthelflæd was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury, who described her as a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul. According to Pauline Stafford, like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages. In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.

Osthryth (died 697), queen of the Mercians, was the wife of King Æthelred and daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his second wife Eanflæd. She probably married Æthelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhflæd had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhflæd's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means stronghold of Flæde, and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s Æthelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by Æthelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that Æthelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. Æthelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. Æthelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against Æthelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother Ælfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King Æthelred had married his sister. The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey.

Sylvia Hyman ( September 9, 1917 – December 23, 2012) was an American ceramic artist, art teacher and visual artist. She was known for her lifelike ceramic pieces and sculptures which are included in the collections of museums worldwide. Her trademark pieces, which were fashioned from stoneware or porcelain, often used the artist technique of trompe -l'œil( meaning deceive the eye or fooling the eye in French) to create the realism of art. Much of Hyman's work featured everyday objects, such as paper, books, or food, realistically crafted from ceramic. She was also the founder of the Tennessee Association of Craft Artists( TACA). Hyman was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1917. She received her bachelor's degree in art education in 1938 from the New York State Teachers College at Buffalo( now Buffalo State College).

Professionally, Hyman worked as a public school art teacher, as well as a faculty member of Peabody College. In 1957, after working as a public school teacher for approximately fifteen years, Hyman received some ceramic equipment, which launched her artistic career as a ceramist. Examples of her work are included in the collections of museums and art collections worldwide including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague, the Saga Prefectural Museum in Saga, Japan, the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville, and the Renwick Gallery in Washington D.C.

Her awards included a Lifetime Achievement Award in the Craft Arts from the National Museum of Women in the Arts of Washington, D.C. in 1993 and the Tennessee Governor ’s Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Arts, which she received in 1994. A book of her artwork, The Intriguing Vision of Sylvia Hyman: Trompe l ’ Oeil Ceramic Artist, edited by Janet Mansfield, was published in 2012. Sylvia Hyman died in Nashville, Tennessee, on December 23, 2012, at the age of 95.

Executive Director Susan Edwards of the Frist Center for the Visual Arts, where Hyman held a major exhibition called Sylvia Hyman: Fictional Clay in 2007, praised Hyman's legacy in an interview with The Tennessean following her death, telling the newspaper, There are few ceramists anywhere more revered than Nashville's own, Sylvia Hyman ... In her long and productive career, encompassing abstraction and realism, Sylvia showed us the remarkable power of touch and the potential of clay. Her exhibition at the Frist( in 2007) remains one of our most well- received locally. The 2007 exhibition had marked her 90th birthday.

1104,"National Velvet are a Canadian goth rock band, popular in the 1980s and 1990s. The band members have included vocalist Maria Del Mar, guitarist Mark Crossley, guitarist Tim Welch, bassist Mark Storm, saxophonist Chris Weiss and drummer Garry Flint. The band came together after a chance meeting between Del Mar and Storm in an alley during a party in Toronto, Ontario; that initial meeting was actually an argument about musical taste, because Storm was a fan of gothic rock bands such as Bauhaus, while del Mar was into Spanish classical music, Motown, swing music and punk rock. Maria del Mar worked the coat check at Toronto nightclub The Diamond, while Tim Welch was the lighting technician there. Six months later, they released a self-titled independent EP, before signing to Intrepid Records in 1987. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1988, and spawned the radio single Flesh Under Skin. In 1989, their single and video for 68 Hours garnered them a CASBY Award. Their follow-up album, Courage was recorded in England with producer Zeus B. Held, and was released in 1990. The album was supported by a cross-Canada tour, and gave the band further radio airplay for the singles Shine On and Sex Gorilla. (The latter title was a band in-joke. The song had actually been written as Sarsparilla, but the fans kept misunderstanding the lyrics, so the band relented and retitled the song.) Sex Gorilla also led to a fan tradition of throwing bananas at the stage during their shows. The band subsequently left Capitol Records, and released their third and final album Wildseed in 1995 on the independent label Iron Music. Despite frequent confusion, Del Mar is not the same person as television actress Maria del Mar. She has continued to work in the Toronto music scene, including gigs with Classic Albums Live and with the Rolling Stones tribute band Midnight Ramblers. Storm was reported missing in November 2002. The following June, his body was found in Lake Ontario. The band has performed periodically, including shows at Toronto's Bovine Sex Club in 2011 and 2012, and continue to perform at select venues.

Luis Buñuel Portolés( 22 February 1900 – 29 July 1983) was a Spanish- born Mexican filmmaker who worked in France, Mexico and Spain. When Buñuel died at age 83, his obituary in The New York Times called him an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant- garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later. His first picture, Un Chien Andalou —made in the silent era—was called the most famous short film ever made by critic Roger Ebert, and his last film, That Obscure Object of Desire —made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. Writer Octavio Paz called Buñuel's work the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality ... scandalous and subversive. Often associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Buñuel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and an array of genres, including experimental film, documentary, melodrama, satire, musical, erotica, comedy, romance, costume dramas, fantasy, crime film, adventure, and western. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Buñuel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, Buñuel nearly always made Buñuel films.

He was one of three former holders of that post, along with Gerard Mansell and John Tusa, to oppose the plans of John Birt to merge the service into the BBC. After Birt became director general of the BBC in 1992, he had planned to end the service's independent status at Bush House in central London, and absorb it within the rest of the corporation. Kark led a varied career before his tenure with the BBC. He was the son of a London army major who became a publisher. He attended Upper Canada College in Toronto, the Nautical College in Pangbourne, the Royal Naval College, and Magdalen College, Oxford. He became a Royal Navy midshipman in 1944, serving two years with the East Indies fleet, aboard and HMS London. In 1948 at Oxford, Kark directed the first production of Jean-Paul Sartre's The Flies.

They had one daughter. He became a BBC reporter in 1954 and became head of the South European service at Bush House in 1964. His experiences in South Europe fuelled his interest in the region, particularly Greece; he would later write guidebooks about the country. Kark moved to the East European and Russian service in 1972. The following year he became Editor of the World Service. He advised the last governor of Rhodesia, Lord Soames, on broadcasting the 1979 election in that country. He became controller of engineering services in 1974.

Kark was the man-in-the-middle of another great BBC controversy – the launching of the BBC World television service to complement its radio counterpart. The idea was first mooted by Kark's predecessor, Douglas Muggeridge – the nephew of the broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge. Kark retired in 1986. Kark was a man of broad interests, especially involving southern Europe and the Commonwealth. He became a trustee of the Commonwealth Journalists' Association in 1993. In retirement, he wrote Attic in Greece (1994), and The Forwarding Agent (1999), a spy thriller set in the Middle East that was praised by the crime writer PD James, an old friend. Most of his book was written at his home in Nauplion, a small town in the Peloponnese, where he and his wife Bawden spent much of their time. In London, the couple lived in Islington, in a house backing on to the Grand Union Canal. His hobbies included real tennis, travelling and studying mosaics.

Wong Kar- wai( born 17 July 1958) is a Chinese film director. His art films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal, unconventional approach, and his films frequently appear on best- of lists domestically and internationally. Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama As Tears Go By( 1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles.  Days of Being Wild( 1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time( 1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre. The production of Ashes of Time was time- consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express( 1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046( 2004) and The Grandmaster( 2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

The Master of Ambrass was a Bohemian painter active probably in Prague at the end of the fourteenth century. He was the creator of the Wiener Musterbuch, a set of silverpoint studies and subjects all dated to the same period, which were used as models in painters' studios. Among the subjects are bust- length images of Christ, the Virgin, various saints, the Crucifixion, and the Annunciation. The pictures are collected in groups of four, affixed to fourteen small framed panels. Three independent designs also exist, depicting a philosopher and astronomer, a sibyl and John the Evangelist, and the Three Magi; these, too, were probably part of the set. Such is the realism of the designs that it is believed the Master had contact with an artist of the Franco- Flemish school. Also attributed to his hand, dubiously, is an Annunciation at the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Stylistically, the Master's work bears some similarities to that of the Master of the Pähl Altarpiece. He is sometimes conflated with both the Master of the Gerona Martyrology and the Master of the Rajhrad Altarpiece, but this attribution is not universally accepted.

It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture( Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and independent festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles. During his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film The Earth is a Sinful Song( 1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier( 1985) making it the 17th highest- grossing movie in the history of Finland.

The first Dominican site in England was at Oxford, in the parishes of St. Edward and St. Adelaide. The friars built an oratory to the Blessed Virgin Mary and by 1265, the brethren, in keeping with their devotion to study, began erecting a school. Actually, the Dominican brothers likely began a school immediately after their arrival, as priories were legally schools. Information about the schools of the English Province is limited, but a few facts are known. Much of the information available is taken from visitation records. The visitation was a section of the province through which visitors to each priory could describe the state of its religious life and its studies to the next chapter. There were four such visits in England and Wales—Oxford, London, Cambridge and York. All Dominican students were required to learn grammar, old and new logic, natural philosophy and theology. Of all of the curricular areas, however, theology was the most important. This is not surprising when one remembers Dominic's zeal for it.

St Josephs Academy was an all- boys Roman Catholic academy located in Blackheath, London, United Kingdom. Saint Joseph's Academy began life in 1860 as an extension of the work of the Brothers in Saint Joseph's College, Clapham. Bishop Grant asked them to start a new school in Saint George's parish, Kennington. The Brothers who taught in the Academy initially belonged to the Clapham Community and travelled each day to Kennington. ( The Bishop agreed to provide the money for their fares on the omnibus.) Then, in January 1865, they were set up as a separate Community under the leadership of Brother Acheul as the first Director. The Academy operated in Kennington for 56 years. In 1916 it moved to Camberwell for a few years and finally it moved to Lee Terrace in 1919 to become Saint Joseph's Academy, Blackheath. In 1977 Saint Joseph's Academy made the transition from grammar school to comprehensive school. Unfortunately, it was one of those schools that did not cope well with the change. There followed a period of gradual decline from the former glory days throughout the 1980s. Also during the 1980s, Saint Austin's Boys School, Charlton, merged with Saint Joseph's Academy and for some time the Saint Austin's site was used for the lower school. Eventually, the site in Charlton was repurposed as the site for Christ the King Sixth Form College before moving to its current site on Belmont Hill. Starting in the early 1990s, the school went through a particularly troubled period with a series of OFSTED inspections that placed it in a category of either ‘ special measures ’ or ‘ serious weaknesses ’ for eleven years. In 2002, at the initiative of the headteacher, Peter Stickings, and the chairman of governors, Brother Ben Foy, it was suggested that the only remedy for the terminal decline of St Joseph's would be for it to become part of the Academies programme, which was then being vigorously promoted by the government as a way of rescuing schools in serious difficulties, especially in London. The proposal involved the closure not only of Saint Joseph's Academy but also that of the neighbouring Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School and their joint re-emergence as a 3 -16 all- through co-educational Academy. High- level discussions on the feasibility of the proposal took place involving the De La Salle Trustees, the Diocese of Southwark, the DfES and Lewisham Authority. All parties agreed that it was an idea worth pursuing. The co-sponsors of the Academy would be the Diocese and the De La Salle Trustees, the latter providing most of the land for the site of the new Academy. This Academy emerged as St Matthew Academy as of September 2007.

Swarthmore High School was a four- year public high school in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania serving the Boroughs of Swarthmore and Rutledge. Swarthmore established its own independent school district when Swarthmore Borough incorporated in 1893. The Swarthmore and Rutledge School Districts merged in 1955. In 1971 the Swarthmore- Rutledge District merged with adjacent Nether Providence School District to create the Wallingford- Swarthmore School District. After Pennsylvania state officials determined that Swarthmore was too small for its own secondary schools, Swarthmore High School merged with Nether Providence High School in Wallingford to form Strath Haven High School in the fall of 1983. The merged school was and still is based at the former Nether Providence campus. The building that was Swarthmore High School is now the Swarthmore Rutledge School, an elementary school in the Wallingford- Swarthmore School District.

Alex Ranarivelo is a French-Malagasy filmmaker, born in Saint-Jean-d'Angely, France. He studied film at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. After making his feature film debut with the rough-and-tumble romantic comedy from a guy's perspective Alpha Males Experiment (aka Knuckle Draggers), Alex was hired to direct the action film Born to Race, which he co-wrote with fellow Art Center alum Steven Sarno. When producer Ali Afshar and executive producer Forrest Lucas created ESX Entertainment, Alex was brought on to direct their first film, the suspenseful, character-driven The Dog Lover (starring James Remar, Lea Thompson, and Sherry Stringfield). Next came , which follows a 17-year-old Iranian refugee who becomes the high school wrestling champion against adversity during the Iran hostage crisis of 1980. In this period piece, Alex directed Jon Voight, William Fichtner and discovered newcomers George Kosturos and Lia Marie Johnson. The film won multiple awards on the festival circuit including Best Picture and Best Ensemble at the Boston Film Festival, the audience award at the Austin Film Festival and the audience award at the Napa Film Festival. Next came Running Wild, where Alex was at the helm of a picturesque, dramatic piece about a California Ranch Socialite poised to lose everything who creates a Prison Rehabilitation Equine Program after finding starving wild horses on her property.

Adémar II de Poitiers, known in Old Occitan as Ademar or Aimeric de Peiteus, was the count of Valentinois and de facto ruler of Diois from 1188 or 1189 until 1230. He was the son of Count Guillaume and grandson of Count Adémar I. He married Philippa, daughter of Guillaume- Jourdain, the lord of Fay, and Météline de Clérieu. The Finnish scholar Aimo Sakari hypothesised that Philippa of Fay was the famous trobairitz known as the Comtessa de Dia, and that the friend( amic) mentioned by the Comtessa in her poems was the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras. Around 1195 – 96, Adémar himself participated in a three- way torneyamen( a type of collaborative poem) with Raimbaut de Vaqueiras and Perdigon. On 4 May 1187, Adémar joined his father in making a donation to the charterhouse of La Sylve- Bénite. After his father's death, Adémar received a letter from the Emperor Frederick I, written at Lyon on 21 July 1188, warning him to cease levying tolls in the Diois, which were illegal under certain privileges the emperor had extended to the bishops of Die. In March 1189, Adémar granted a charter of liberties to his vassal, Silvion, the lord of Crest, who controlled the valley between Valentinois and Diois. An inscription in marble was made of this charter and survives. In it Adémar refers to himself as Ademar of Poitiers, count of Valentinois. Bishop Robert of Die, who had made the complaint to the emperor about Adémar's tolls, was the major witness of this charter of liberties. In June 1189, Count Raymond V of Toulouse—in his capacity as margrave of Provence—and Adémar signed an agreement whereby the former renounced his rights in the Diois in return for the latter's fealty and homage. This is probably the occasion on which Adémar broke with the lords of Baux, and alluded to in the poem Leus sonetz si cum suoill by the Raimbaut de Vaqueiras. It was not, however, the occasion upon which the counts of Valentinois began calling themselves counts of Diois, a title rightly belonging to the bishops. The counts of Valentinois had long quarrelled and vied for power with their neighbours, counts of Albon. In 1191, Countess Beatrice of Albon, who was married to Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, signed a pact with Guillaume de Clérieu l' Abbé against Adémar. In 1192, Adémar confirmed a donation the count of Toulouse made at Léoncel, and in 1196 he granted the town a charter of liberties. In 1193, on the occasion of the consecration of the church of Montmeyran by Bishop Falco of Valence, the count of Valentinois granted it and its prior, Ponce, some of his vassals, without effecting the freedoms and exemptions they enjoyed under him. In 1197 Adémar and Philippa made a donation to the charterhouse of Bonnefoy, which her father had founded in 1156. When he made a donation to the priory of Rompont on 31 January 1202, the day of his son Guillaume's birth, he asked God to preserve his child's life so that he could work for the glory and good of the church. Ademar sought to take more control of local lands from William of Savoy, bishop of Valence. Silvion of Crest sought the support of the bishop against Ademar, and the bishop led forces which captured many of Ademar's men. There was an initial peace treaty in 1227, with a more final treaty concluded in 1231. Ademar had at least one son, William( Guillaume), who married Flotte de Royans and had a son, Ademar III. William died in 1227, and the fate of his widow and son were a key part in the resolution of the conflict with William of Savoy. Ultimately, she remarried to Aymon II de Faucigny.

Robert Frederick Christy( May 14, 1916 – October 3, 2012) was a Canadian- American theoretical physicist and later astrophysicist who was one of the last surviving people to have worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He briefly served as acting president of California Institute of Technology( Caltech). A graduate of the University of British Columbia( UBC) in the 1930s where he studied physics, he followed George Volkoff, who was a year ahead of him, to the University of California, Berkeley, where he was accepted as a graduate student by Robert Oppenheimer, the leading theoretical physicist in the United States at that time. Christy received his doctorate in 1941 and joined the physics department of Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1942 he joined the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where he was recruited by Enrico Fermi to join the effort to build the first nuclear reactor, having been recommended as a theory resource by Oppenheimer. When Oppenheimer formed the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, Christy was one of the early recruits to join the Theory Group. Christy is generally credited with the insight that a solid sub-critical mass of plutonium could be explosively compressed into supercriticality, a great simplification of earlier concepts of implosion requiring hollow shells. For this insight the solid- core plutonium model is often referred to as the Christy pit. After the war, Christy briefly joined the University of Chicago Physics department before being recruited to join the Caltech faculty in 1946 when Oppenheimer decided it was not practical for him to resume his academic activities. He stayed at Caltech for his academic career, serving as Department Chair, Provost and Acting President. In 1960 Christy turned his attention to astrophysics, creating some of the first practical computation models of stellar operation. For this work Christy was awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1967. In the 1980s and 1990s Christy participated in the National Research Council's Committee on Dosimetry, an extended effort to better understand the actual radiation exposure due to the bombs dropped on Japan, and on the basis of that learning, better understand the medical risks of radiation exposure.

 Love Do n't Live Here Anymore is a song written by Miles Gregory and originally recorded by Rose Royce. It was produced by former Motown songwriter and producer Norman Whitfield for Whitfield Records. Lead vocals were sung by Gwen Dickey and the song was released as the second single from their third studio album Strikes Again. The song was developed as a result of producer Whitfield's interest to work with Paul Buckmaster, the British arranger and composer. Together they asked songwriter Miles Gregory to write a song for them. Gregory's undergoing medical care for his deteriorating physical health became the inspiration behind the song.  Love Do n't Live Here Anymore incorporated the use of the Electronic LinnDrum machine, and was one of the first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument. The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco's house, where Dickey was present during the recording. After its release, the song was critically appreciated, but was only moderately successful commercially. It reached a peak of 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and five on the Hot Black Singles chart. It achieved its highest position in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it reached number two.  Love Do n't Live Here Anymore has been covered by a number of artists, including Madonna, Morrissey – Mullen, Jimmy Nail and Faith Evans. Madonna's version was included in her second studio album Like a Virgin( 1984), and it was the idea of Michael Ostin, the head of the A&R department of Warner Bros. Records, that Madonna record a cover version of the song to include in the album. A remix of Madonna's cover was included in her 1995 ballad compilation album Something to Remember. The original and the remixed version of the Madonna song differ in that the latter uses more classical instruments. The 1995 version also received a number of club remix treatments. Critics were not impressed with the version present in Like a Virgin, calling it awful, while they warmed to the version present in Something to Remember. However, it was a commercial disappointment, reaching a peak of only 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was promoted by a music video shot by Jean- Baptiste Mondino, which portrayed Madonna in an empty suite of an abandoned hotel, and was shot in a single take.

The United East India Company, sometimes known as the United East Indies Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie; or Verenigde Oost - Indische Compagnie in modern spelling; abbreviated to VOC), better known to the English - speaking world as the Dutch East India Company or sometimes as the Dutch East Indies Company, was a multinational corporation that was founded in 1602 and became defunct in 1799. It was originally established as a chartered company to trade with India and Indianized Southeast Asian countries when the Dutch government granted it a 21 - year monopoly on the Dutch spice trade. The VOC was an early multinational corporation in its modern sense. In the early 1600s, by widely issuing bonds and shares of stock to the general public, the VOC became the world's first formally listed public company. In other words, it was the first corporation to be ever actually listed on an official stock exchange. The VOC was influential in the rise of corporate - led globalization in the early modern period. With its pioneering institutional innovations and powerful roles in world history, the company is considered by many to be the first major modern global corporation, and at its height was the most valuable corporation ever.

Archie Prince Albert Hunt( December 20, 1896- March 21, 1931) from Denton, Texas was an American country blues fiddle player. He was one of the founders of the musical genre later defined as Western swing. Hunt was born as Archie Albert Hunt in Terrell, Texas to Archibald Hunt and Manasa Emma Lee Skates, both of whom were blues musicians. As a child, he learned to play the fiddle by stealing his father's instrument and self- teaching himself in a nearby graveyard. Though much of Hunt's personal life is obscure, it is known he served in the First World War, and his first professional work as a musician was as a member in a traveling minstrel show, in the early 1920s. On March 28, 1928, Hunt and his group, the Texas Ramblers, which included violinist Harmon Clem and an unknown guitarist, recorded in San Antonio for Okeh Records. Of the sides the group laid down, Blues in the Bottle was arguably his most accomplished for its diverse assortment of country blues, ragtime and old- time music. It was later included in Rich Nevins' compilation album, Times Ai n’t Like They Used to Be, Volume 1 along with other contemporaries. In addition to being a recording artist, Hunt regularly performed on local radio stations and venues, usually in blackface, with his neighbors Doc and Oscar Harper. Hunt particularly favored the neighborhood known as Deep Ellum, which was also frequented by other blues musicians, but notorious for its red-light district. On June 26, 1929, Hunt and the Texas Ramblers recorded for the last time, with the session taking place in Dallas. Among the six songs recorded was Wake Up, Jacob which was featured on the renowned compilation created by Harry Everett Smith, Anthology of American Folk Music, in 1952. An unknown composition was cut, but was either never released or no original copies exist. The song, Oklahoma Rag was released as under Prince Albert Hunt and Hermon Clem. The recordings were later seen as a primary influence in Western swing and country music in general. On 31 March 1931 Hunt was shot to death outside Confederate Hall. His assailant, William M. Douglas, reported that he murdered Hunt out of jealousy for dancing with his wife. In 1974, a documentary titled Memories of Prince Albert Hunt was released and was centered on the musician's life.

Henry Aloysius Petre, DSO, MC (12 June 1884 – 24 April 1962) was an English solicitor who became Australia's first military aviator and a founding member of the Australian Flying Corps, the predecessor of the Royal Australian Air Force. Born in Essex, Petre forsook his early legal career to pursue an interest in aviation, building his own aeroplane and gaining employment as an aircraft designer and pilot. In 1912, he answered the Australian Defence Department's call for pilots to form an aviation school, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Military Forces. The following year, he chose the site of the country's first air base at Point Cook, Victoria, and established its inaugural training institution, the Central Flying School, with Eric Harrison. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Petre was appointed commander of the Mesopotamian Half Flight, the first unit of the newly formed Australian Flying Corps to see active service. He led the Half Flight through the Battles of Es Sinn and Ctesiphon, and the Siege of Kut. His actions in the Middle East earned him the Distinguished Service Order, the Military Cross, and four mentions in despatches. Transferring to the Royal Air Force as a major in 1918, he commanded No. 75 Squadron before retiring from the military the following year. Petre resumed his legal practice in England, and continued to fly recreationally until his death in 1962, aged seventy-seven. He was married to racing driver Kay Petre.

His birthday (14 December 1895) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Prince Albert, the Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been rather distressed. Two days later, he wrote again: I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her. Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good. Consequently, he was baptised Albert Frederick Arthur George at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as Bertie. His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name may supplant the less favoured one.

When the Saxon-based Ottonian dynasty of emperors died off with the childless Emperor Henry II, Conrad was elected to succeed him as King in 1024 at the age of 34. Conrad continued the policies and achievements of the Ottonian Henry II regarding the Catholic Church and the affairs of Italy. Conrad continued to build the Church as a center for imperial power, preferring to appoint church bishops over secular lords to important posts across the Empire. Like Henry II before him, Conrad also continued a policy of benign neglect over Italy, especially for the city of Rome. His reign marked a high point of the medieval imperial rule and a relatively peaceful period for the Empire. Following the death of the childless King Rudolph III of Burgundy in 1032, Conrad claimed dominion over the Kingdom of Arles and conquered and incorporated it into the Empire. The three kingdoms (Germany, Italy, and Burgundy) formed the basis of the Empire as the royal triadregna tria).

Appointed Duke of Swabia in 1235, his father had him elected King of Germany (King of the Romans) and crowned King of Italy (as Conrad IV) in 1237. After the emperor was deposed and died in 1250, he ruled as King of Sicily (Conrad I) until his death.

Conrad II or Conrad (III) (12 February 1074 – 27 July 1101) was the Duke of Lower Lorraine (1076–87), King of Germany (1087–98) and King of Italy (1093–98). He was the second son of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy, and their eldest son to reach adulthood, his older brother Henry having been born and died in the same month of August 1071. Conrad's rule in Lorraine and Germany was nominal. He spent most of his life in Italy and there he was king in fact as well as in name.

It was released on September 11, 1931, by RKO Pictures. Her male co-stars liked to tease Marion Shilling during down time and frequently made her blush with their risque comments. A bit later in my life when I became more hip, I thought of some great comebacks, but as with so many marvelous afterthoughts, it was too late, alas, too late.  They also laughed together about their director, who they dubbed Bring 'Em Back Alive. Immaculately groomed, he wore riding pants and pith helmet, and everything he said was with emphasis. His booming voice and the way he dashed about left no doubt to onlookers as to who was directing the picture, Shilling said. The film is preserved in the Library of Congress collection.

Charles B. Pierce (June 16, 1938 – March 5, 2010) was an American film director, screenwriter, producer, set decorator, cinematographer and actor, and is considered one of the first modern independent filmmakers. Pierce directed thirteen films over the span of 26 years, but is best known for his cult hits The Legend of Boggy Creek (1973) and The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976). An Arkansas resident most of his life , Pierce made his directorial debut with Boggy Creek, a faux documentary-style film inspired by the legend of the Bigfoot-like Fouke Monster. The low-budget film grossed roughly $25 million, and Pierce followed that success with several inexpensive, regional films set in the southern United States, including The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on the true story of the Phantom Killer murders in Texarkana. Pierce continued directing films into the 1980s, when he wrote the story for the Clint Eastwood film Sudden Impact. For that screenplay, he is said to have written the phrase, Go ahead, make my day, which became one of the most famous movie quotes in history. After years of pressure from producers, Pierce directed a Boggy Creek sequel, , which he considered the worst film of his career; it was later riffed on by the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Arne Mattsson (2 December 1919 - 28 June 1995) was a Swedish film director, born in Uppsala. His early movies were mostly comedies. His biggest success was Hon dansade en sommar (1951, aka.  One Summer of Happiness), which earned him the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and a nomination for the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952. It caused some controversy at the time because it contained nudity. His 1953 film of Peder Sjögren's second novel, Bread of LoveKärlekens bröd), based on Sjögren's experiences as a volunteer in the Finnish Continuation War of 1941-44 angered the author, was banned in Finland and incurred the wrath of the Soviets at the Cannes Film Festival. In spite of all this, Sjögren grudgingly admitted that as a study of men under severe pressure it was impressive. In 1958 he directed Damen i svart, the first in the series of five Hillman-thrillers, centred on Folke Mellvig's crime-solving middle-class city couple Kajsa and John Hillman. The second in the series, Mannekäng i rött (1958), is considered by some to be a precursor of the Italian giallo films, notably Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace. The popularity of his mystery movies declined and in the 1970s and 1980s he made mostly low-budget thrillers - some in collaboration with Mats Helge Olsson - which got mostly bad reviews.

Rauni Mollberg( April 15, 1929 – October 11, 2007) was a Finnish film director who directed movies and TV movies. In 1963 Mollberg directed movies for YLE. He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera. Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song( 1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically- charged, blood- soaked tale of a young village girl's ill- fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality( Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box- office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture( Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and independent festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles. During his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film The Earth is a Sinful Song( 1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier( 1985) making it the 17th highest- grossing movie in the history of Finland.

She was the daughter of Dafydd ap Llewelyn ap Hywel, otherwise known as Dafydd Gam, who was killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Gwladys was named the star of Abergavenny Gwladys the happy and the faultless by Welsh poet Lewys Glyn Cothi. He describes the lady of Raglan Castle, which she became upon her second marriage, as a brilliant being, like the sun—the pavilion of light. She has been compared to the legendary Queen Marcia for her discretion and influence.

Saint Gwladys ferch Brychan or St Gladys (Latin-Gladusa), daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog, was the queen of the saint-king Gwynllyw Milwr and the mother of Cadoc the Wise, whose vita may be the earliest saint's life to mention Arthur. Gwladys's other children were Cynidr, Bugi, Cyfyw, Maches, Glywys II and Egwine. Today her main church and associated school is in Bargoed.

Gwladys ferch Dafydd was the daughter of Dafydd ap Gruffudd, the last free Prince of Wales, and Elizabeth Ferrers.

Dafydd was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason. Dafydd's sons were imprisoned. Gwladys was dispatched to the Gilbertine convent in Sixhills, Lincolnshire, as a young child.

She is thought to have died there in 1336, outliving her brothers. She is known to have had sisters, who were illegitimate.

Kidane Kale (reigned c. 1718 - c. 1744; literal meaning:  Beginning, Word), better known as Abuye, was a Meridazmach of Shewa, an important Amhara noble of Ethiopia. He was the son of Sebestyanos. Abir states that he ruled for 25 years, although noting that Harris claims he ruled for 15 years, Coulbeaux for 25 (from 1725 to 1750), and d'Hericourt for 60. His wife was Woizero Tagunestiya, daughter of Mama Rufa'el, Governor of Mamameder. Abuye succeeded on the death of his father, and made his capital at Har Amba. Sebestyanos had died by a curious accident, according to Levine. Abuye had been rebuilding some of the churches destroyed by Ahmad Gragn, one of which was in Doqaqit dedicated to St. Michael. Part of the ceremony required the tabot in the church in 'Ayne, where his father was living, and it was secretly removed to Doqaqit. Sebestyanos saw this as an act of rebellion, and set forth to capture and discipline his son; however, in the ensuing battle one of Qedami Qal's servants accidentally killed the Meridazmach. Because his father Sebestyanos refused to give homage to the Emperor of Ethiopia, shortly after Abuye came to power he was confronted with an attack by the army of Emperor Iyasus II. Although Abuye survived this threat unharmed, sources differ on the details. Abir reports one version, that intermediaries arranged an agreement where in exchange for tribute Abuye was officially invested with the title of Meridazmach; Marcus elaborates on this version, adding that Emperor Iyasu was more concerned about suppressing the Wollo Oromo closer to his center of power. Levine notes that a second version claims that Abuye met the Imperial army and defeated it. Abuye continued the military consolidation of the Christian principalities around him, and battling the Oromo invaders. According to Johann Ludwig Krapf, Abuye defeated the ruler of Menz, Gole, and annexed that district to Shewa. He died fighting the Karayu Oromo south of Yifat, and was buried in his capital Doqaqit.

Tito became increasingly ill over the course of 1979. During this time Vila Srna was built for his use near Morovi in the event of his recovery. On 7 January and again on 11 January 1980, Tito was admitted to the Medical Centre in Ljubljana, the capital city of the SR Slovenia, with circulation problems in his legs.

His funeral drew many world statesmen.

Those who attended included four kings, 31 presidents, six princes, 22 prime ministers and 47 ministers of foreign affairs. They came from both sides of the Cold War, from 128 different countries out of 154 UN members at the time.
